<p>It is now upwards of two centuries and a quarter since the despotic
sway of the English Sovereigns over the consciences of their
subjects, induced all who entertained different sentiments from those
of the established church, to turn their eyes towards the wilderness
of America, as an asylum from the unnatural persecutions of the
Mother Country.</p>

<p>With this in view, some of the principal men among those who
had already sought a refuge in Holland, commenced treating with
the Virginia Company, and at the same time took measures to ascertain
whether the King would grant them liberty of conscience should
they remove thither. They ultimately effected a satisfactory arrangement
with the Company, but from James they could obtain no
public recognition of religious liberty, but merely a promise, that if
they behaved peaceably he would not molest them on account of
their religious opinions.</p>

<p>On the 6th of September, 1620, a detachment from the Church
at Leyden set sail from Plymouth for the Virginia territory, but
owing to the treachery of the master,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> they were landed at Cape
Cod, and ultimately at Plymouth, on the 11th day of December
following. Finding themselves without the jurisdiction of the Virginia
Company, they established a distinct government for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1624, the success of this plantation was so favorably
represented in the West of England, that the Rev. John White,
a distinguished minister in Dorchester, prevailed upon some merchants
and others to undertake another settlement in New England.
Having provided a common stock, they sent over several persons to
begin a plantation at Cape Ann, where they were joined by some
disaffected individuals from the Plymouth settlement. This project
was soon abandoned as unprofitable, and a portion of the settlers
removed westward within the territory of Naumkeag, which then
included what is now Manchester. By the intercession and great
exertions of Mr. White, the project of a settlement in that quarter
was not altogether relinquished, but a new company was soon
afterwards formed. One of this company, and the principal one to
carry its objects into immediate effect, was the subject of this Memoir.
He was in the <em>strictest</em> sense of the word a <em>Puritan</em>,&mdash;one of a sect
composed, as an able foreign writer has said, of the "most remarkable
body of men which perhaps the world has ever produced.
They were men whose minds had derived a peculiar character from
the daily contemplation of superior beings and eternal interests.
Not content with acknowledging in general terms an overruling
Providence, they habitually ascribed every event to the will of the
Great Being for whose power nothing was too vast, for whose inspection
nothing was too minute. To know him, to serve him, to
enjoy him, was with them the great end of existence. They rejected
with contempt the ceremonious homage which other sects substituted
for the homage of the soul. On the rich and the eloquent, on
nobles and priests, they looked down with contempt; for they esteemed
themselves rich in a more precious treasure, and eloquent
in a more sublime language; nobles by the right of an earlier creation,
and priests by the imposition of a mightier hand."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">John Endecott</span>, whose name is so intimately associated with
the first settlement of this country, and with whose early history his
own is so closely interwoven, that, in the language of the late Rev. Dr.
Bentley,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "above all others he deserved the name of <em>the</em> <span class="smcap">Father of
New England</span>," was born in Dorchester, Dorsetshire, England, in
the year 1588. He was a man of good intellectual endowments
and mental culture, and of a fearless and independent spirit, which
well fitted him for the various and trying duties he was destined to
perform. Of his early life, and private and domestic character, little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
is known; neither are we much better informed as to his parentage,
except that his family was of respectable standing and moderate
fortunes. He belonged to that class in England called esquires, or
gentlemen, composed mostly at that period of the independent landholders
of the realm. With the exception, therefore, of a few leading
incidents, we are reluctantly obliged to pass over nearly the
whole period of Mr. Endecott's life, previous to his engaging in the
enterprise for the settlement of New England. History is almost
silent upon the subject, and the tradition of the family has been but
imperfectly transmitted and preserved. His letters, the only written
productions which are left us, furnish internal evidence that he was
a man of liberal education and cultivated mind. There are proofs
of his having been, at some period of his life, a surgeon;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> yet, as
he is always alluded to, in the earliest records of the Massachusetts
Company, by the title of Captain, there can be no doubt whatever
that at some time previous to his emigration to this country, he had
held a commission in the army; and his subsequently passing
through the several military grades to that of Sergeant Major-General
of Massachusetts, justifies this conclusion, while the causes which
led to this change in his profession cannot now be ascertained.</p>

<p>While a resident in London, he married a lady of an influential
family, by the name of Anna Gouer, by whom, it is understood, he
had no children. She was cousin to Matthew Cradock, the Governor
of the Massachusetts Company in England. If tradition be
correct, the circumstances which brought about this connection were
similar to those which are related of John Alden and Miles Standish.
Some needle-work, wrought by this lady, is still preserved in the
Museum of the Salem East India Marine Society.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Mr. Endecott
was also a brother-in-law of Roger Ludlow, Assistant and Deputy
Governor of Massachusetts Colony, in the year 1634, and afterwards
famous for the distinguished part he took in the government of
Connecticut.</p>

<p>But Mr. Endecott's highest claim to distinction rests upon the fact
that he was an intrepid and successful leader of the Pilgrims, and
the earliest pioneer of the Massachusetts settlement under the Patent.
His name is found enrolled among the very foremost of that noble
band, the fathers and founders of New England&mdash;those pious and
devout men, who, firm in the faith of the gospel, and trusting in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>God, went fearlessly forward in the daring enterprise, and hewed
their homes and their altars out of the wild forest, where they could
worship "the God of their fathers agreeably to the dictates of their
own consciences." Such was the persecution to which the Non-conformists
in England were at this period subjected, that the works of
nature were the only safe witnesses of their devotions. Deriving no
honor, so far as we know, from illustrious ancestry, Mr. Endecott
was the architect of his own fame, and won the laurels which encircle
his name amid sacrifices, sufferings, and trials, better suited to adorn
an historical romance, than to accompany a plain tale of real life.</p>

<p>Under the guidance and influence of the Rev. Mr. Skelton, he
embraced the principles of the Puritans; and in the beginning of
the year 1628, associated himself with Sir Henry Roswell, Sir John
Young, Simon Whetcomb, John Humphrey, and Thomas Southcoat,
in the purchase of a grant, "by a considerable sum of money," for
the settlement of the Massachusetts Bay, from the Plymouth Council
in England. This grant was subsequently confirmed by Patent
from Charles I. Mr. Endecott was one of the original patentees,
and among the first of that company who emigrated to this country.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the objects of the first settlers generally
in colonizing New England, there can be no doubt that <em>his</em> was the
establishment and enjoyment of the gospel and its ordinances, as
he supposed, in primitive purity, unmolested. With him it was
wholly a religious enterprise.</p>

<p>He sailed from Weymouth, in the ship Abigail, Henry Gauden,
master, on the 20th of June, 1628, and arrived in safety at
Naumkeag, the place of his destination, on the 6th of September
following. The company consisted of about one hundred planters.</p>

<p>The following extract from "Johnson's Wonder-Working Providence"
will illustrate the estimation in which he was held at this
period. "The much honored John Indicat came over with them, to
governe; a fit instrument to begin this Wildernesse-worke; of courage
bold, undaunted, yet sociable, and of a cheerfull spirit, loving
and austere, applying himselfe to either as occasion served. And
now let no man be offended at the Author's rude Verse, penned of
purpose to keepe in memory the Names of such worthies as Christ
made strong for himselfe, in this unwonted worke of his.</p>

</div></div>

<p>To this company, under Endecott, belongs the honor of having
formed the first permanent and legally recognized settlement of the
Massachusetts Colony. We do not say that they were the <em>first</em> white
men who ever trod the soil; for we know when Endecott landed
on these shores, he found here a few fishermen and others, the remnant
of a planting, trading, and fishing establishment, previously
commenced at Cape Ann, under the auspices of some gentlemen
belonging to Dorchester, his native place, but soon abandoned for
want of success. Their leader, the Rev. John Lyford, had already
emigrated to Virginia, and those of that company who removed
their effects to Salem, consisted at that time of some five or six persons,
most of whom were seceders from the settlement at Plymouth.
They were, however, only sojourners, disaffected with the place,
and requiring all the interest and entreaties of the Rev. John White,
a noted minister in Dorchester, to prevent them from forsaking it
altogether, and following Mr. Lyford to Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But higher motives
and deeper purposes fired the souls and stimulated the hearts
of Mr. Endecott and his friends to commence a settlement, and
to form new homes for themselves and their posterity in this wilderness,
before which the mere considerations of traffic and gain
sink into comparative insignificance. It was the love of religion
implanted deep in the heart, that gave impulse and permanency to
the settlement at Naumkeag, and the Massachusetts Colony generally;
and the commencement of this era was the arrival of Endecott
with the first detachment of those holy and devout men who valued
earthly pursuits only so far as they were consistent with religion.
It was also at this period that a sort of definite reality was imparted
to this region. Previously to this it had been viewed as a sort of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra incognita</i>, situated somewhere in the wilderness of America.
But the arrival of the Pilgrims at this time dispelled the uncertainty
in which it had before been wrapped, and at the same time threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
around it the warmest sympathies and most earnest solicitude of
large numbers who had now become deeply interested in its welfare.
We, therefore, consider the landing of Endecott at this place, as emphatically
the commencement of its permanent settlement, as an
asylum for the persecuted and oppressed of the Mother Country. All
previous visitors were comparatively adventurers, with motives and
purposes widely different from those of that little band who first rested
upon this spot on the 6th of September, 1628. On that day, so to
speak, was breathed into the settlement of Naumkeag the breath of
life, and it became as it were endued with a living soul, folding within
its embrace the dearest interests and most cherished rights of humanity,
unrivalled in the interest she will ever excite as the most
ancient town in the Massachusetts Patent.</p>

<p>On Mr. Endecott's arrival, he made known to the planters who
preceded him, that he and his associate patentees had purchased
all the property and privileges of the Dorchester partners, both here
and at Cape Ann. He shortly after removed from the latter place,
for his own private residence, the frame house, which a few years
before had been erected there by the Dorchester Company. It was
a tasteful edifice, of two stories high, and of the prevailing order of
architecture at that period, called the Elisabethean, which was but
of slight remove from the Gothic. Some of its hard oak frame may
still be found in the building at the corner of Washington and
Church streets, Salem, commonly known at this day as the "Endicott
House."</p>

<p>The alteration which now took place in the affairs of the infant
colony did not meet with favor from the first planters, and for a
while prevented perfect harmony from prevailing in the settlement.
"One of the subjects of discord was the propriety of raising tobacco,
Mr. Endecott and his council believing such a production, except
for medicinal purposes, injurious both to health and morals." Besides
this, they probably viewed with no favorable eye the agreement
in sentiment between Mr. Endecott and the Plymouth
Church as to the propriety of abolishing the ritual forms of worship
of the Church of England; for an adherence to which they had
already been obliged to leave the Plymouth settlement. Mr. Endecott
represented these difficulties to the home government; and
in answer to his communication they say, "That it may appear
as well to all the worlde as to the old planters themselves, that we
seke not to make them slaves, as it seems by your letter some of
them think themselves to be become by means of our patent, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
are allowed to be partakers with us in all the privileges we have
with so much labor and intercession obtained from the King; to be
incorporated into the society, and enjoy not only those lands which
formerly they have manured, but such a further proportion as the
civil authorities think best." They were also allowed the <em>exclusive</em>
privilege of raising their favorite weed&mdash;tobacco.</p>

<p>The Company's Court in London, actuated by that true sense of
justice which ever marked its deliberations, were determined not to
trespass on any of the rights of the aborigines; and to this purpose
in their first two communications to Mr. Endecott, they desired
him to take especial care, "that no wrong or injury be offered by
any of our people to the natives there," and to satisfy every just
claim which might be made by them to the territory of Naumkeag
and the plantation generally. To this record the sons of the Pilgrims
have ever turned with peculiar pride and exultation. And,
says Felt, "From his well-known promptitude and high sense of
equity, there can be no doubt that Mr. Endecott fulfilled every iota
of such instructions." In his first letters to the home government,
he suggested various things to advance the interests of the Colony;
such as the manufacture of salt, cultivation of vineyards, sending
over fruit-stones and kernels, grain for seed, wheat, barley, and rye;
also certain domesticated animals; all of which were shortly after
transported to this country.</p>

<p>The answer to this letter bears the date of April 19, 1629,
wherein they inform him, that the Company "are much enlarged
since his departure out of England," and for strengthening their
grant from the Council at Plymouth, they had obtained a confirmation
of it from his Majesty by his Letters Patent, under the
broad seal of England; incorporating them into a body politic, with
ample powers to govern and rule all his Majesty's subjects that
reside within the limits of their plantation; and that, in prosecution
of the good opinion they have always entertained of him, they
have confirmed him Governor of the Colony. No adventitious
circumstances of fortune or birth aided him in his appointment to
this, even then responsible office; for although the Colony was at
this time few in numbers and feeble in effort, yet in its success
were involved the most momentous interests, and every thing depended
upon the right impulse and direction being given to its
affairs. In the words of the Record, "having taken into due consideration
the <em>meritt</em>, <em>worth</em>, and <em>good desert</em> of Captain John Endecott,
and others lately gone over from hence, with purpose to resyde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and continue there, wee have with full consent and authoritie of
this Court, and ereccon of hands, chosen and elected the said Captain
John Endecott to the place of present Governour of said Plantation."
They further speak of the confidence they repose in him,
in thus committing the affairs of the Colony into his hands. Gov.
Cradock also compliments him upon his motives and conduct; and
the Company inform him, that they are disappointed of the provisions
ordered to be sent for himself and Mrs. Endecott, but (God
willing,) they purpose to send them by the next vessel. It is also
believed that at this time Mr. Endecott ordered the fruit-trees, which
afterwards constituted his orchard upon the farm granted him in
1632, of which one venerable patriarch, the celebrated old pear-tree,
yet remains, having withstood the "peltings of pitiless storms" for
upwards of two hundred winters, and still dropping down its rich
fruit into the bosoms of his distant descendants.</p>

<p>In a second letter, dated the 28th of May following, the Company
remark: "Wee have sithence our last, and according as we
there advised, at a <em>full</em> and <em>ample</em> Court assembled <em>elected</em> and <em>established</em>
you, Captain John Endecott, to the place of present Governour
of our Plantation there, as also some others to be of the
Council with you, as more particularly you will perceive by an
Act of Court herewith sent, confirmed by us at a General Court
and sealed with our common seal."</p>

<p>The model of the Government established by this "Act of
Court," consisted of a Governor, and twelve persons as a Council,
styled "<span class="smcap">The Governour and Council of London's Plantation
in the Mattachusetts Bay in New England</span>." They were to
elect a Deputy-Governor, for the time being, from among their
number; were authorized also to choose a Secretary and other
needful officers. They were empowered to fill vacancies in their
body, occasioned by death or otherwise. The Governor, or in his
absence the Deputy, might call Courts at pleasure, and they had
power to establish any laws not at variance with those of England;
"to administer justice upon malefactors, and inflict condign punishment
upon all offenders." To make an act valid, the Governor
or his Deputy was always to vote with the majority. A form of
oath was sent over at this time to be administered to Mr. Endecott
as Governor, and one also for the other officers of the government.
He took the oath and was inducted into office. Here, then, we
conceive, is direct and incontrovertible testimony that Endecott was
appointed the <em>first</em> Governor of Massachusetts under its Colonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Charter from the King. It is so stated by Joselyn, Hutchinson,
and Prince. He received the Charter, and the documentary evidence
of his constitutional authority as Governor, both at the same
time. To Mr. Endecott was given, to act under it, all the powers
which his immediate successors ever exercised. They were conferred
upon him too, by the same body who subsequently elected
Mr. Winthrop to that office. The abolishment of the board of
control in England, and the transfer of "the government of the
plantation to those that shall inhabit there," and instead of choosing
the Colonial Governors in Old England by members of the Company
there, to choose them by members of the same Company who
were in New England, could not weaken the validity of his claim
to be considered the <em>first</em> Governor of the Massachusetts Colony.</p>

<p>It was well for Mr. Endecott that he possessed an ardent and
sanguine temperament, which nothing could daunt, otherwise the
innumerable discouraging circumstances which met him in this, his
new abode, in every form, amid sickness, death, and privations of
every kind, well suited to appal the stoutest hearts, would no doubt
have wrought their effects upon him, to the prejudice of the whole
plantation. But such was the energy and firmness of his character,
aided, no doubt, by a religious enthusiasm, which induced the belief
that it was the purpose of God to give them the land of the
heathen as an inheritance, that neither his faith nor confidence in
the ultimate success of the undertaking ever for a moment forsook
him. In every crisis, this little band looked to him, as the weather-beaten
and tempest-tossed mariner looks to his commander, next to
God, for encouragement and support; and they did not look in vain.
Such was the great mortality among them, during the first winter
after their arrival, arising from exposure to the rigors of an untried
climate, and their being badly fed and badly lodged, that there were
scarcely found in the settlement well persons enough to nurse and
console the sick. To enhance their distress, they were destitute
of any regular medical assistance. In this painful dilemma a messenger
was despatched by Mr. Endecott to Gov. Bradford, of the
Plymouth settlement, to procure the necessary aid; and Doctor
Samuel Fuller, the physician, who was a prominent member and
deacon of the Plymouth Church, was sent among them. During his
visit, Mr. Endecott was called by Divine Providence to suffer one of
the heaviest of earthly afflictions, in the death of his wife, the partner
of all his sorrows, who had forsaken home, kindred, and the sympathy
of friends, and consented to share with him the cares and privations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
incident to a new settlement. Surrounded by savages, and
from the circumstances of the case, placed in a great degree beyond
the pale of civilized society, her sympathy and counsel must necessarily
have been very dear to him. She must have entwined herself
about his affections, as the tender ivy winds itself round the lordly
oak. Her slender and delicate frame was not proof against the
rigors of a New England climate. Born and nurtured in the midst
of luxury and ease, she could not withstand the privations and
hardships of her new home, and she fell a victim to her self-sacrificing
disposition. Painful indeed must have been the parting, and
severe the trial to Mr. Endecott. Under the influence of the feelings
which this affliction produced, he wrote the following letter
to Gov. Bradford:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent smcap">"Right Worshipfulle Sir,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a thing not usual that servants of one Master, and of the same
household, should be strangers. I assure you I desire it not; Nay, to
speak more plainly, I <em>cannot</em> be so to <em>you</em>. God's people are all marked
with one and the same mark, and have for the main one and the same
heart, guided by one and the same spirit of truth; and where this is
there can be no discord, nay, here must needs be a sweet harmony;
and the same request with you, I make unto the Lord, that we as
Christian brethren be united by an heavenly and unfeigned love, binding
all our hearts and forces in furthering a work beyond our strength
with reverence and fear, fastening our eyes always on Him that is only
able to direct and prosper all our ways. I acknowledge myself much
bound to you, for your kind love and care in sending Mr. Fuller amongst
us, and rejoice much that I am by him satisfied, touching your judgment
of the outward form of God's worship: It is as far as I can gather
no other than is warranted by the evidence of truth, and the same
which I have professed and maintained ever since the Lord in mercy
revealed himself unto mee, being far from the common report that hath
been spread of you in that particular; but God's people must not look
for less here below, and it is a great mercy of God that he strengtheneth
them to go through it. I shall not need at this time to enlarge
unto you for (God willing) I propose to see your face shortly; in the
mean tyme, I humbly take my leave of you, committing you to the
Lord's blessing and protection, and rest.</p>

<p class="right">Your assured loving friend,<br />
<span class="smcap">Jo: Endecott</span>.
</p>

<p>Naumkeag, May 11, 1629."</p></div>

<p>The foregoing epistle is alike honorable to the head and heart of
Mr. Endecott. Humble, devout, and chastened feelings pervade it
throughout. It speaks a mind sensibly alive to religious impressions.
The sentiments here expressed cannot fail to find a response in the
hearts of all reflecting men, in this and succeeding generations.
The magnitude of the undertaking in which they were engaged, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
necessity of union in their efforts, and the impossibility of success
without direct divine assistance, are here represented in language
appropriate and devout.</p>

<p>Whether Mr. Endecott carried into execution his design intimated
in this letter, of making Gov. Bradford a visit "shortly," is uncertain.
On the 27th of May, 1629, in a communication to the authorities at
home, he complained that some persons in his jurisdiction disregarded
the law of 1622, for the regulation of trade with the Indians,
and "desiring the Company would take the same into their serious
consideration, and to use some speedy means here for reformation
thereof." A petition was in consequence presented to the King,
who in compliance therewith issued a new proclamation, forbidding
such disorderly trading. These steps were no doubt taken in reference
to the associates of one Thomas Morton, whose residence at
Mount Wollaston, or Merry Mount, now Quincy, he visited shortly
after his arrival in this country. This man and his associates had
alarmed all the well-disposed settlers, from Piscataqua to Plymouth,
by selling arms and ammunition to the Indians, indulging themselves
in dissipation, and otherwise endangering the peace and
welfare of New England. The object of Mr. Endecott's visit was
to rectify abuses among the remaining confederates, Morton himself
having been already apprehended, and sent home to England for
trial. He went there, we are told, in the "purefying spirit of authority,"
and caused their May-pole to be cut down, to which they had
been in the habit of affixing pieces of satirical composition against
those who opposed their wishes and practices, and "rebuked the inhabitants
for their profaneness, and admonished them to look to it
that they walked better." He also changed the name of the place,
and called it Mount Dagon. The precise period of this visit is not
known, and it is not improbable that Mr. Endecott extended his
journey at the time to Plymouth Colony. However this may be,
a warm friendship soon grew up between Gov. Bradford and himself,
which continued without interruption for the remainder of
their lives.</p>

<p>As yet no steps had been taken in the Colony towards the establishment
of a reformed Church for propagating the gospel, which
they professed above all to be their aim in settling this Plantation.
June 30th, 1629, the Rev. Francis Higginson arrived at Naumkeag,
and the Rev. Mr. Skelton, the early friend and spiritual father of
Mr. Endecott, arrived about the same time. They had been sent
over by the home government. Mr. Higginson thus speaks of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
reception by Mr. Endecott: "The next morning (30th) the Governor
came aboard to our ship, and bade us kindly welcome, and
invited mee and my wiffe to come on shore and take our lodgings
at his house; which we did accordingly." The settlement, we are
told, then consisted of "about half a score of houses, with a fair house,
newly built, for the Governor. We found also abundance of corne
planted by them, very good and well liking. Our Governor hath a
store of green pease growing in his garden, as good as ever I eat in
England. *&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* Our Governor hath already planted a
vineyard, with great hopes of increase; also mulberries, plums, raspberries,
currants, chesnuts, filberts, walnuts, small nuts, hurtleberries,
and haws of white thorn, near as good as our cherries in England&mdash;they
grow in plenty here."</p>

<p>Shortly after the arrival of Mr. Higginson and Mr. Skelton, the
necessary measures were taken preparatory to the settlement of a
religious congregation in accordance with the views of the Puritans.
In this they were aided by Mr. Endecott, and the most intelligent of
the colonists. Having first concluded a satisfactory form of church
government and discipline, which was submitted to Mr. Endecott
for approval, the 6th of August, 1629, just eleven months after
his arrival, was the time selected for this "little band of devout Pilgrims
to enter into solemn covenant<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> with God and one another,
and also for the ordaining of their ministers." By Mr. Endecott's
order, a solemn day of "humiliation" had been held on the 20th of
July preceding, for the choice of pastor and teacher. An important
step was about to be taken&mdash;a new priesthood was about to be
established&mdash;all allegiance to, or alliance with, any other church on
earth was about to be dissolved! It was a subject of momentous
concern with the Colonists, and called into exercise all their moral
heroism and spiritual courage. Mr. Bradford, the Governor of the
Plymouth Colony, came here by sea, and arrived just in season to
give the right hand of fellowship. Of all that little band, gathered
together on this occasion, none felt a deeper interest, or took a more
responsible part, than the subject of this Memoir.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>We now approach an important event in the history of the Colony&mdash;the
removal of its entire government to New England. Gov.
Cradock, with whom the idea appears to have originated, acquainted
the Proprietors, at a meeting of the Court, July 28, 1629, that, for the
purpose of advancing the interests of the Plantation, and inducing
and encouraging persons of worth and quality to transport themselves
and their families thither, as well as for other weighty reasons,
it was proposed to transfer the entire government to this country,
and continue it no longer in subjection to the Company in England.
Soon after this communication, an agreement to that effect was
drawn up at Cambridge, and among those who signed it was their
future governor, John Winthrop. It was one of the stipulations that
they should settle their affairs so as to be ready for the voyage hither
by the first of March. This appears to have been the first connection
Mr. Winthrop had with the settlement of this soil. On the 29th
of August following, at a meeting of the Court of Proprietors, in
London, this change in the government was decided upon. On the
16th of October, at another meeting of the Court, it was conceived
"fitt that Capt. Endecott continue the government there, unless just
cause to the contrarie." But on the 20th of the same month, Gov.
Cradock informed the Proprietors that in accordance with the alteration
of the government now about to take place, it was necessary to
elect a new Governor, Deputy, and Assistants; when John Winthrop
was put in nomination, and unanimously chosen Governor. In like
manner, John Humphrey was chosen "Deputy-Governor," and Sir
Richard Saltonstall, Matthew Cradock, John Endecott, with fifteen
others, were chosen a board of "Assistants."</p>

<p>On the 12th of June, 1630, the ship Arbella, Capt. Milburne, having
on board Gov. Winthrop and company, and a duplicate
Charter of the Colony, of the same tenor and form as Gov. Endecott's,
arrived at Naumkeag, having sailed from Cowes March 29.
Mr. Endecott, who had already been apprized that he was shortly
to be superseded in the Governorship of the Plantation, repaired on
board to welcome the new Governor, and offer him and his friends
the hospitalities of his house. Among the distinguished personages
were Isaac Johnson and his wife, the Lady Arbella, daughter of the
Earl of Lincoln. Speaking of Mr. Endecott's visit, Gov. Winthrop
says, "Wee that were of the Assistants and some other gentlemen
and some of the women, returned with him to Nahumkeck, where
we supped on good venison pastry and good beer." At the time of
the arrival of the new Governor, wholesome and salutary laws for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the government of the Colony had been instituted by Endecott,
under the authority given him by the Charter, and the settlement
had already assumed the condition of a well-organized and
regulated body politic. A church, with faithful ministers, which
they professed to value above all temporal interests and earthly
grandeur, had also been established, and the wheels of government
were moving on harmoniously, upon a safe and sure foundation.
Under this state of things, Endecott now surrendered the civil power
into the hands of Gov. Winthrop, and took upon himself the more
humble appointment of one of the Assistants. Yet "the principles of
Winthrop's administration," says the Annalist of Salem, "were like
those which had directed the course of his predecessor. The commencement
of legislation, which was to have an important part in
promoting social freedom, that has spread and is spreading in the
world, <em>began</em> at Naumkeag, under Endecott, and was <em>continued</em> by
his worthy successor."</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of Gov. Winthrop, the new settlers began
to be dissatisfied with Salem, as the capital of the Colony. It did
not combine, in their opinion, sufficient advantages of location, soil,
and natural means of defence. A party, therefore, was sent to explore
the country westward, to discover, if possible, some more
suitable situation. It had been the darling object with Endecott to
make Salem the seat of government; he, however, bowed in submission,
and continued his efforts to advance the common weal.</p>

<p>On the 18th of August, 1630, Gov. Endecott entered into a new
matrimonial alliance with Elisabeth Gibson of Cambridge, England.
This lady probably came over in the ship with Gov. Winthrop, and
the marriage ceremony was performed by him and the Rev. Mr.
Wilson, afterwards pastor of the first church in Boston. This connection
appears to have been a happy one, although there was a
much greater disparity in their ages than prudence and judgment
would seem to allow&mdash;the difference being about twenty-six years.</p>

<p>Such was his ardent and growing attachment to the place of his
adoption, that when it was decided in December, 1630, to fortify
Newton, now Cambridge, for the seat of government, and to build
houses, and move their military stores to that place next spring, he
could not be prevailed upon to quit his accustomed residence. All
the members, except himself and Mr. Sharp, who was about returning
to England, agreed to do so; but Mr. Endecott excused himself
upon the ground that he had so formed his connections in Salem,
that it would be attended with great inconvenience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 3rd of July, 1632, the Court of Assistants granted Mr.
Endecott three hundred acres of land, called by the Indians in English,
"Birchwood," afterwards known as his "Orchard Farm." It
was situated between two and three miles in a northerly direction
from the main settlement at Salem, upon a tongue of land bounded
on the north, south, and east by rivers, or more properly inlets of the
sea, and on the west by the main land. Even at that early period,
it was one of the most desirable situations in that vicinity. Though
at some distance from the place which was afterwards selected for
the seat of the government, and where the Court House was erected,
yet he was in the centre of the population, being by land nearer to
the shores than he was to the cultivated farms around him. It was
many years after he established himself at this beautiful place, so
near all the streams which passed through the adjacent country,
before any incorporation separated Salem from the Merrimack.
For twenty years Salem bounded on Andover. The spot then was
the best he could have chosen. On a commanding eminence, which
overlooked the country for some distance around, and about one
eighth of a mile from one of the inlets, he built his house, and commenced
in earnest the cultivation of his farm. Although the ploughshare
has frequently passed over it, yet part of the cellar of this house
is plainly discernible at the present day. It is a romantic situation,
and denotes him to have been a man of much discrimination and
taste in matters of this kind. On his farm he lived in a sort of feudal
style, surrounded by his servants.</p>

<p>In front of his mansion house, and immediately upon the southern
slope of a gentle declivity, he planted his far-famed orchard,
which gave the name to his farm. The tradition that the Governor
always pointed out his dial, which bears the date of 1630, as denoting
the age of his orchard, seems to indicate that the trees were
removed hither from his town residence. Here, too, it is said, he
introduced, for medicinal purposes, as well as ornament to his
garden, the "white-weed," which has since become so detrimental
to the hay-fields of our farmers.</p>

<p>His usual mode of transporting himself and family to and from
this place, was at first by water, and he was as often visited by his
friends in this way, as in any other. The inlet before the mansion
house had nothing to interrupt it&mdash;the passage was open to the bay,
and at that early period must have been delightfully romantic. The
shores on either side thickly clothed with wood, whose dark images
were reflected in the still waters beneath them, were picturesque in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the extreme. The bold jutting headlands, on some parts of the
passage, lent a sublimity to the prospect, which was continually
varying by the winding and circuitous course of the stream.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
There was nothing to break the stillness, or disturb the quiet which
reigned around, save the dashings of their own little boat amid the
waters, or the heavy plunge of some lordly sea-bird, in his gyratory
wanderings in pursuit of prey. The smoke from the humble and
solitary wigwams of the Indians, thinly scattered along the margin
of the waters, with an occasional glimpse at their tawny inhabitants,
as they stealthily watched the passing boat from their leafy hiding-places,
or listlessly reclined under the shadow of some wide-spreading
oak, heightened the effect, and diversified the scene. Within
the last half-century, the ruins of some of these wigwams might
have been seen,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and could not have failed to excite most melancholy
reflections respecting the wretched fate of these natural lords
of the soil, throughout our vast country.</p>

<p>August 2, 1634, Mr. Endecott was called to mourn the death of
his early and particular friend, the Rev. Mr. Skelton, who had become
endeared to him as his spiritual guide, in first opening to his
view the way of truth while in England, and who had followed
him to this country to counsel and direct him in paths of piety and
happiness. This event must have been to him a severe affliction.</p>

<p>About this time a Military Board of Commissioners, with almost
unlimited powers, was established by the General Court, and Mr.
Endecott was appointed one of its members.</p>

<p>On the 18th of September, this same year, the Colony was thrown
into consternation, and alarmed for its liberties, by the news from
England, that a commission had been granted to two Archbishops,
and ten others of the Council, conferring on them the authority to
regulate the Plantations of New England; to establish and maintain
the Episcopal Church in this country; to recall its Charter;
remove its Governors; make its laws; hear and decide its legal
cases; and appoint its punishments, even death itself.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Intelligence
was also received at the same time, that a new Governor was being
secretly conveyed to Massachusetts, with orders which, if executed,
would prostrate all its civil and ecclesiastical rights. Gov. Cradock
had already informed them that the King's Council had demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>their Charter. Such was the universal anxiety this news awakened,
that the idea of resistance appears immediately to have possessed
the minds of the inhabitants,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and the fortifications were hastened
forward, and an assessment laid of an additional rate of five hundred
pounds for defence. These tidings were received with indignant
feelings by Mr. Endecott. He saw by this step that all their dear-bought
privileges, purchased at such immense sacrifices, which none
could better appreciate than himself, were about to be violently, as
with a ruthless despotism, wrested from them. His independent
spirit could not quietly brook such high-handed infringements upon
their chartered rights, and he resolved in all the affairs of the Colony,
in which he had any share or influence, to pursue that course which
he deemed most for her interests, whether it led him over plains or
mountains, through flowers or thorns. There was exhibited in his
actions, on all occasions, a fortitude, which shows him formed for
great emergencies. Probably under the influence of feelings produced
by this intelligence, and excited by that ardent zeal which
marked his character through life, he shortly after cut the red cross
from the King's colors, deeming it a relic of Popish idolatry. This
bold and daring act was considered an insult, as well to the established
Church of England, as to the King himself; and the Colony
dared not refrain from taking cognizance of it, lest it should call
down upon their heads the vengeance of the whole British hierarchy.
There is ample evidence in the records of the Colony, that most of
the principal men, including Governor Winthrop,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> agreed with him
on this subject, in sentiment and feeling. "The only difference
between him and others was, he manifested his opinions by his acts,
while they, with more prudence and safety, retained theirs in secret."
Had it not been for fear of the consequences, instead of being censured,
his conduct would have been openly applauded. His boldness
of action was made known in England, and looked upon there
in the light of rebellion. It was the first blow struck in defiance of
royal authority, and would no doubt have cost Mr. Endecott his life,
had it not been for those troubles which were then beginning to
gather thickly, like a tempest, about the devoted head of the unfortunate
Charles I., and which eventually burst upon it with a fury which
nothing could resist, involving in its course the ruin of his government,
and the destruction of his own life. The sword, with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>this rebellious act is said to have been performed by Mr. Endecott,
has been preserved, and is now in possession of one of the family,
to whom it has descended in direct line, by right of primogeniture.
It is a plain, unornamented rapier, emblematical of the Puritan simplicity
of our Forefathers.</p>

<p>While these events were passing in this country, the Puritans in
England were experiencing the most unmitigated persecution, at
the hand of Archbishop Laud and his confederates. As their numbers
increased, the various modes of punishment were multiplied;
exorbitant fines were imposed; the pillory witnessed bloody
scenes of human agony and mutilation; the scaffold and dungeon
had their victims; the lash, the shears, and the glowing iron were
most cruelly applied to individuals of this proscribed sect.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But
the faith of the Puritans rose superior to oppression, and could not
be overcome. The most bloody persecution served only to add
new converts to their cause.</p>

<p>In 1636, Mr. Endecott was appointed an Assistant, and was also
sent on an expedition against the Indians on Block Island and in the
Pequot country, he acting as General of all the forces in the detachment.
During this year his views relative to the cross in the King's
colors triumphed over all considerations, and the Military Commissioners
ordered it to be left out. On the ensigns at Castle Island,
in Boston harbor, they substituted the King's arms for the cross.</p>

<p>During the year 1641, Mr. Endecott was chosen Deputy-Governor,
and was continued in office for the two succeeding years. He
was also appointed one of a committee to dispose of all lands or
other property belonging to the company at Cape Ann; and was
commissioned by the Court, in conjunction with two others, Mr.
Downing, the brother-in-law of Gov. Winthrop, and Mr. Hathorne,
to procure the transcription of nineteen copies of the laws, liberties,
and forms of oaths, and to subscribe them with their own hands,
the Court having decreed that no copies should be considered authentic
which were without their signatures.</p>

<p>In 1642, he was chosen one of the Corporation of Harvard College.</p>

<p>Passing over some minor things in the life of Governor Endecott,
we arrive at the year 1644, when his increasing influence and popularity
ensured his election as Governor, and Mr. Winthrop was
chosen Deputy-Governor. The claim of Salem to be made the seat
of government, was now again revived, and it would be fair to infer
from his well-known attachment to the place, that the project met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
with his hearty coöperation. But the effort was not successful, and
Boston still continued to be the capital. The Governor's salary
was one hundred pounds.</p>

<p>During this year of his administration, improvements in the mode
of transacting business in the Legislature were introduced. The
Magistrates and Deputies, for the first time, now held their sessions
apart, and it required the concurrence of both bodies, to make an
act valid. The office of a speaker to the Deputies was also this
year ordained, and filled by an Essex man, Mr. William Hathorne.</p>

<p>The conflicting claims of D'Aulney and La Tour, two Frenchmen
at Acadia, which had produced considerable excitement, were
finally settled during this year, by the government of France supporting
the claim of D'Aulney. His deputy came to Boston, and
concluded a treaty with Gov. Endecott, which was subsequently
ratified by the Commissioners of the United Colonies of New
England.</p>

<p>The year following, (1645) Mr. Endecott was succeeded as Governor
by Mr. Dudley. Other offices of honor and trust, however,
awaited him. He was this year appointed Sergeant Major-General
of Massachusetts, the highest military office in the Colony. He had
previously held a commission of Colonel in the first regiment formed
in Salem, Saugus, Ipswich, and Newbury, in 1636, when John
Winthrop, Jr., son of the Governor, was his Lieutenant-Colonel.
He was also elected an Assistant, and one of the United Commissioners.</p>

<p>In 1648, he was continued an Assistant, Sergeant Major-General,
and Commissioner for the Province.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Governor Winthrop, which took place on the
26th of March, 1649, at the age of 61, Mr. Endecott was again chosen
Governor, to which office he was annually elected until the time of
his death, with the exception of the years 1650 and 1654, when he
held that of Deputy-Governor. This was an eventful period in the
history of the Colony, as well as of the Mother Country. The violent
death of Charles I., the usurpation of Cromwell, and the restoration
of the Stuart family, took place while he was at the head of
public affairs. The difficulties and perplexities of his situation
during this period were very great. But all his public acts were
marked with a moderation and wisdom which do honor to him as
an experienced statesman. Had he possessed less integrity or firmness,
had his mind been at all vacillating, the consequences might
have been affectingly disastrous to the best interests of the Colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1652, under his administration, a mint was established
in the Colony, for coining shillings, six-pences, and three-pences.
No other of the American Colonies, it is believed, ever
presumed to coin metal into money. Though unlawful, it was
passed over by Cromwell and the Parliament, and continued after
the Restoration, for more than twenty years.</p>

<p>About the year 1655, Gov. Endecott removed from Salem to
Boston, upon the request of the General Court that he would do so,
"if his own necessary occasions would permit." Although the reasonableness
of this request must have been apparent to him, the step
could not have been taken without strong feelings of repugnance.
It must have been a severe struggle for him to have separated himself
from the place of his adoption, towards which he had ever felt
and exhibited the most ardent attachment. His residence in Boston
was on the beautiful lot lately owned and occupied by Gardner
Green, now Pemberton Square.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Governor Endecott had now (1657) entered upon his seventieth
year, with a shattered constitution, and health seriously impaired, as
we learn by the following letter to Mr. John Leverett, the Colonial
Agent in England.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I cannot write unto you by a more faithful friend<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> than I have done,
who is able at large, to relate to you how things in general stand here.
And that doth save mee some labour which at this tyme is a favor to
mee. For in the extremity of heate and after a long sickness, I am
very faint; not fitt to doe any thing, yet I cannot but by these heartilie
salute you in the Lord, giving you many thanks for what you sent me.
For all good newes is welcome to us as you know full well. Yet I
cannot for the present answer your expectations touching Road Island
and Clarke and Holmes, but I have acquainted the rest of the Magistrates
with your letter, who were already to gather up sufficient testimonie
to prove what you spoke to the Protector, and enough to satisfy
(we doubt not) your opponent, if he be a lover of truth. Only we
would have the General Court act with us therein, which will not
meet till September next, when I hope I shall procure a full answer
to your former and last letters.</p>

<p>What the end is of that point of State to make the Protector King,
I cannot fathom it; unless their proffering and his deniall thereof ingratiate
him the more in the hearts of the people. The Lord in mercie
guide all to his glory, and the good of those commonwealths over
whom he hath sett him. If there be any opportunitie I pray you write
mee a word about it, and other occurrences that may fall out. I cannot
be sufficientlie thankefulle for what you wrote me last. Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>motions there are in the world which the Lord direct and turn to his
glorie, the overthrow of his enemies and the peace and welfare of his
own people. Which is the prayer of Sir,</p>

<p class="right">
Your verie loveing friend and servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">Jo: Endecott.</span>
</p>

<p>Boston, the 29th 4th mo., (June,) 1657.</p>
</div>

<p>During the principal part of Gov. Endecott's administration, and
particularly from 1655 to 1660, the Colony, "under his prudent and
equal government," made rapid progress in all things necessary to
its respectability and importance. Its population and wealth rapidly
increased; its trade flourished; and its foreign intercourse became
every day more widely extended. Free admission was allowed to
vessels of all nations, and the importations of all commodities was
subject to no incumbrance or restraint. The Colony took no notice
of any act respecting navigation, or other laws made in England
for the regulation of trade. They were never recognized as in
force here, unless required by their own legislature.</p>

<p>In 1658, the Court granted Gov. Endecott, "for his great service,
the fourth part of Block Island." At this time he was also elected
President of the body of Colonial Commissioners. He now held
the double office of Governor of Massachusetts and President of the
United Colonies.</p>

<p>His conduct towards the aborigines, that much abused and injured
people, was always marked with forbearance, lenity, and mildness.
To his eldest son John, the Indians in 1660 gave a tract of
land, which grant he applied to the Court to confirm. The Court
declined taking such power on itself; but at the same time, however,
it passed the highly complimentary resolve:</p>

<p>The Court, "considering the many kindnesses which were shown
the Indians by our honored Governor in the infancy of these Plantations,
for pacifying the Indians, tending to the common good of
the Planters; and in consideration of which the Indians were
moved to such a gratuity unto his son, do judge meet to give the
petitioner four hundred acres of land."</p>

<p>Though Governor Endecott removed from Salem to Boston in
1655, yet neither he nor Mrs. Endecott removed their connection
with the Salem church, until November, 1664. A large and brilliant
comet made its appearance on the 17th of November of this
year, and continued to the 4th of February following. It was the
general belief of that period, that comets were omens of great evil.
One appeared just before the death of that distinguished divine,
the Rev. John Cotton; and the death at this time of their aged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Governor, and the troubles with which the Colony met the next
year from the King's Commissioners, Hutchinson informs us, tended
to confirm the people in their opinion.</p>

<p>We are told that "old age and the infirmities thereof coming
upon him, he fell asleep in the Lord on the 15th of March, 1665,"
at the age of 77, "and was with great honour and solemnity interred
at Boston," on the 23rd of the same month. His death was
easy and tranquil. Tradition has handed down the fact, that the
"Chapel Burying-Ground" was the place of his interment. But
the exact spot is not now known. No stone marks the resting-place
of this intrepid Father of New England.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Yet his name
alone will ever be a monument to his memory, more enduring than
marble, and as imperishable as the granite hills of his adopted
country.</p>

<p>Gov. Endecott came to this country in 1628, at the age of 40,
and died in 1665, at the age of 77. During these thirty-seven years
he was nearly all the time in public life, and for about seventeen
years, or nearly half the whole period, he was Governor of the
Colony. He was longer at the head of the administration than
any other Governor of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>He was a man of highly respectable natural talents, good education,
a zealous Puritan, a brave man, a decided patriotic republican,
a friend of learning and religion, a lover of God and his country.</p>

<p>We frankly acknowledge that the conduct of Gov. Endecott in
the religious intolerance of his day, may be considered a stain upon
his escutcheon. Yet, while we admit that those severe measures
which were adopted, especially when contrasted with the present
unrestrained exercise of religious freedom in our country, were great
blemishes on his administration, we think they certainly ought not
to be regarded as such on his moral character. It was not the cause
of religion alone, which was thought to be endangered by the dissemination
and triumph of such principles as were then advanced;
but the overthrow of all civil government was looked upon as the
ultimate result. Besides, the <em>whole</em> responsibility and obloquy of this
dark page in our early history, should not be thrown upon him. True,
he was the official organ through which was carried into effect the
established laws of the Colony, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi</i> was believed to be
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox Dei</i>. But so far as he was individually concerned, we think
his motives were pure and elevated, and that all his actions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
based upon principle. Without doubt he partook largely of the
prevailing prejudices of the day; and the wild spirit of fanaticism
found in him a strenuous and energetic opponent. But we hold
that all men should be judged according to the light of the age in
which they live, and the influences with which they are surrounded.
In this dread of unlimited toleration he was not alone; it was the
prevailing temper of the times, and the errors in this respect, in
which he shared in common with the wise and good of his day,
arose rather from an error in judgment than any obliquity of heart.</p>

<p>It has been remarked by a recent writer, that "Governor Endecott
was undoubtedly the finest specimen to be found among our Governors
of the genuine Puritan character,&mdash;of a quick temper, which
the habit of military command had not softened,&mdash;of strong religious
feelings, moulded on the sterner features of Calvinism;
resolute to uphold with the sword what he received as gospel truth,
and fearing no enemy so much as a gainsaying spirit." "He was
a very virtuous gentleman," says Secretary Morton, "and was
greatly beloved of the most, as he well deserved." "In his public
and private relations," says the Annalist of Salem, "he was a man
of unshaken integrity. <em>For my country and my God</em>, was the
motto inscribed upon his motives, purposes, and deeds. That he
had his imperfections, there is no doubt; but that he exhibited as
few of them under his multiplied duties, as the most excellent men
would in his situation, is equally correct. His many exertions for
the prosperity of Salem, and his ardent attachment to it, should impress
his name and worth upon the hearts of its inhabitants, so long
as its existence continues."</p>

<p>Thus lived and thus died, one of the principal founders and firmest
pillars of New England.</p>

<p>At his decease he left a widow and two sons. The elder son left
no children;&mdash;the younger was a physician, and resided in Salem.
He was twice married; and a family of five sons and five daughters
survived him. His second wife was Elisabeth, daughter of Governor
Winthrop, and widow of the Rev. Antipas Newman of Wenham.</p>

<p>There exists a perfect genealogy of the Governor's family, so far
as relates to his descendants in New England. We hope to publish
it in our next number.</p>

<p>The Governor, and all his descendants, to the third generation,
(1724,) spelt their names <em>Endecott</em>; since then an <em>i</em> has been substituted
for the <em>e</em> in the second syllable.</p>

<p>There is an original portrait of the Governor in possession of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of the family, taken the year he died. By this we learn that his countenance
was open, energetic, and independent, possessing much
individuality of expression, and in perfect harmony with the character
of the man. According to the custom of the age, he wore
mustaches, and a tuft of hair upon his chin. The miniature likeness
which accompanies this Memoir was engraved from this portrait, and
is considered an excellent resemblance, and was presented by the
family to the New England Historic Genealogical Society, Boston,
at their solicitation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The Charter posesssed by Gov. Endecott, and which is now in the Salem Athenæum,
and the Charter possessed by Gov. Winthrop, and which is now in the State House,
Boston, appear to be duplicate original Charters, provided for in the Charter itself, and neither
of them copies. They are precisely alike in all respects&mdash;the same in phraseology and chirography,
and the same in dates. Each Governor was elected and commissioned by the same
Company, and by the same Colony, acted under the same Charter, with the same authority,
and each alike entitled to the official designation of Governor, whether he was elected Governor
by the Company in London, or by the Colony here, for both were elected Governor by each.</p></div>

    </div>

<p>We Covenant with our Lord, and one with another; and we do bind
ourselves in the presence of God, to walk together in all his ways, according
as he is pleased to reveal himself unto us in his blessed word
of truth; and do explicitly, in the name and fear of God, profess and
protest to walk as followeth, through the power and grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>We avouch the Lord to be our God, and ourselves to be his people,
in the truth and simplicity of our spirits.</p>

<p>We give ourselves to the Lord Jesus Christ, and the word of his
grace, for the teaching, ruling, and sanctifying of us in matters of worship
and conversation, resolving to cleave unto him alone for life and
glory, and to reject all contrary ways, canons, and constitutions of men,
in his worship.</p>

<p>We promise to walk with our brethren, with all watchfulness and
tenderness, avoiding jealousies and suspicions, back-bitings, censurings,
provokings, secret risings of spirit against them; but in all offences to
follow the rule of our Lord Jesus, and to bear and forbear, give and forgive,
as he hath taught us.</p>

<p>In public or private, we will willingly do nothing to the offence of
the church; but will be willing to take advice for ourselves and ours, as
occasion shall be presented.</p>

<p>We will not in the congregation be forward, either to show our own
gifts and parts in speaking or scrupling, or there discover the weakness
or failings of our brethren; but attend an orderly call thereunto, knowing
how much the Lord may be dishonored, and his gospel and the
profession of it slighted, by our distempers and weaknesses in public.</p>

<p>We bind ourselves to study the advancement of the gospel in all
truth and peace, both in regard to those that are within or without; no
way slighting our sister churches, but using their counsel as need shall
be; not laying a stumbling-block before any, no, not the Indians, whose

<p>In preparing this article we have consulted various writers on
the subject of Heraldry, and not only selected our thoughts from
theirs, but used their language when it appeared best adapted to
our object. For a more full account of Heraldry in all its branches,
we refer our readers to Guillim's Banner Displayed, Camden's
British Remains, Kent's Grammar of Heraldry, Edmonson's Complete
Body of Heraldry, Leigh's Accidence of Armorie, Playfair's
British Baronetage, Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, Noble's History
of the College of Arms, Lower's Curiosities of Heraldry,

England, and the various Encyclopædias.</p>


<h3>DEFINITION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Heraldry</span> is the science of conventional distinctions impressed
on shields, banners, and other military accoutrements; or it is the
art of armory and blazoning, or the knowledge of what relates to
the bearing of arms, and the laws and regulations appertaining
thereto. Arms in heraldry are ensigns armorial or marks of honor
borne upon shields, banners, and coats of mail, in order to distinction.
The science of Heraldry consists particularly in the appropriation
of figurative representations, designed, by suitable emblems, to
exhibit the achievements of valor, the descent of hereditary honors,
and the distinctions appertaining to nobility.</p>

<p>The Degrees of Honor existing in England in 1597, were nine;
of which five were <em>noble</em>, as Gentleman, Esquire, Knight, Baron,
and Lord; and four were <em>excellent</em>, as Earl, Marquess, Duke, and
Prince.&mdash;The Degrees of Honor existing in the British nation in
1847 are eleven; namely, Gentleman, Esquire, Knight, Baron, Baronet,
Lord, Viscount, Earl, Marquess, Duke, and Prince.</p>


<h3>ORIGIN AND HISTORY.</h3>

<p>Arms may belong to individuals, to families, or to countries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Badges and emblems on shields and helms occurred in the earliest
times. In Numbers, (<em>chap.</em> i: 52,) the children of Israel are enjoined
to pitch their tents, "every man by his own camp and every
man by his own standard," with the ensigns of his father's house.
The Greek and Roman poets speak of paintings and devices on
shields and helmets. These symbols were, moreover, hereditary.
Thus Xenophon relates that the kings of the Medes bore a golden
eagle on their shields. Suetonius asserts that Domitian had a
golden beard for his coat of arms; and Tacitus says of the ancient
Germans, that they marked their shields with brilliant colors, and
that certain standards were borne before them in battle. Notwithstanding
these traces of armorial bearings in the ancient world, our
heraldry is no older than the tournaments. That armory first
became common and regulated by certain rules at these solemn
festivals, is corroborated by the following reasons. In the first place,
we find no tomb or monument with escutcheons, older than the
eleventh century. The most ancient monument of this kind is
said to be the bearings of a certain Varmond, count of Vasserburg,
in the church of St. Emmeran, at Ratisbon. The shield is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupé</i>
of argent and sable; over it is a lion, with the words "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anno Domini</i>
MX." On most of the other tombs, even of the eleventh century,
no arms are found; and the use of them seems to have first become
common in the twelfth century. The first pope who can be proved
to have had a coat of arms, is Boniface VIII., who filled the papal
see from 1294 to 1303. All the earlier papal arms are the fanciful
inventions of later flatterers. On coins, also, no armorial ensigns
are found till the thirteenth century. A second proof of our
assumed origin of coats of arms is the word <em>blason</em>, which denotes
the science of heraldry in French, English, Italian, and Spanish.
This word has most probably its origin in the German word <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">blasen</i>,
(to blow the horn;) for whenever a new knight appeared at a tournament,
the herald had to sound the trumpet, and, because all
appeared with close visors, to proclaim and explain the bearing of
the shield or coat of arms belonging to each. Because this was
performed by the herald, this knowledge was called heraldry; and
because, in doing so, he blew the trumpet, it was called <em>blazoning
the arms</em>. That this was a prevailing practice at tournaments, may
be proved from the poetry of the Troubadours of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries. Thence it came, that those knights, whose
right to appear at tournaments had already been announced by
blazoning their arms, bore two trumpets on their crest. From the
Germans, this custom was transmitted to the French; for there is
no doubt, that tournaments were usual in Germany much earlier
than in France. But the French carried to far greater perfection
the tournament, and the blazon or heraldry connected with it, as
they did the whole system of chivalry. Since, moreover, the
French language prevailed at the court of the Norman kings in
England, pure French expressions have been preserved in British
heraldry. Thus the green tincture, (color,) in a coat of arms, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
termed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vert</i>, (though in French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sinople</i>, which originally denoted a
<em>reddish brown</em>;) bright red is termed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gueules</i>, probably with an allusion
to the bloody revenge of wild animals, which play so conspicuous
a part in heraldry; the divided shield is, moreover, called
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupé</i>; and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passant</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">regardant</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dormant</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couchant</i>, &amp;c., are used.
German heraldry, on the contrary, contains almost pure German
expressions. In a coat of arms, the helm is placed upon the
shield, and the latter is surrounded by the wreath. At a tournament,
the mantle of the knight, with the helm and shield, was suspended
in the lists. The colors or tinctures of the shields had their
foundation in the custom of the most ancient Germans, of giving
their shields various colors&mdash;a custom which received a tender
meaning in the tournaments of the middle ages; the knight, bound
to defend the honor of dames, and devote himself to their protection,
wearing their colors on his shield. By degrees, the partitions
or sections on shields came into use; for when, as often occurred,
a knight was the champion of several ladies, he bore several colors
on his shield, which had therefore to be divided into fields. When
the martial youth of almost all Europe left their homes, about the
end of the eleventh century, inspired with religious enthusiasm, to
conquer the Holy Land, the use of arms became still more general
and necessary. In order to distinguish the nations, armies, and
families, the princes and commanders chose their symbols, sometimes
in commemoration of the exploits and events of the campaign,
or of the dignity of the commander, and sometimes from
mere fancy or passing humor.</p>


<h3>BLAZONING, HISTORIFYING, AND MARSHALLING ARMS.</h3>

<p>Blazoning is the methodical description of a bearing. In the
first place, the shield is described according to its tinctures, figures,
and partitions. The inferior parts of an escutcheon are then blazoned&mdash;the
helm, with its insignia, which are trumpet, wings, and
plumes, men and animals, or their members; then the wreath and
its tinctures; after which the coronet cap, &amp;c.; finally the supporters,
the mantle, the device, and other secondary things. Such
terms for the color must be used as are agreeable to the station and
quality of the bearer. All persons below the degree of noble must
have their coats blazoned by colors and metals; noble men by
precious stones; and kings and princes by planets.</p>

<p>In emblazoning shields of arms, metals, colors, and furs are used
to depict the device, the technical terms of which are these;&mdash;of
metals, gold, called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">or</i>, and silver, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">argent</i>, only are employed;&mdash;of
colors, red, called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gules</i>, blue, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">azure</i>, black, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sable</i>, green, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vert</i>, and
purple, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">purpure</i>;&mdash;and of furs, principally the skin of the little
animal called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ermine</i>, and a combination of grey and white squirrel
skins, called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vair</i>.</p>

<p>In blazoning arms it is an established rule with heralds, that animals
are always to be interpreted in the best sense, that is, according
to their most noble and generous qualities, that the most honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
may redound to the bearers. Thus the fox, being reputed witty
and given to filching for his prey, if this be the charge of an
escutcheon, we are to conceive the quality represented to be his
wit and cunning, and not his theft.</p>

<p>All savage beasts are to be figured in their fiercest action: as a
lion erected, his mouth wide open, his claws extended; and thus
formed he is said to be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rampant</i>. A leopard or wolf is to be portrayed
going as it were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pedetentim</i>, which form of action suits their
natural disposition, and is called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passant</i>. The gentler kinds are to
be set forth in their noblest and most advantageous action, as a
horse running or vaulting, a greyhound coursing, a deer tripping, a
lamb going with smooth and easy pace.</p>

<p>Every animal is to be represented as moving or looking to
the right side of the shield; and it is a general rule, that the right
foot be placed foremost, because the right side is reckoned the beginning
of motion. The upper part is nobler than the lower, and
things that are constrained either to look up or down, ought rather to
be designed looking upwards. We observe however that notwithstanding
such precepts of Guillim and other masters of armory,
there are lions <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passant</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couchant</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dormant</i>, as well as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rampant</i>, and
most animals in arms look down and not up. Birds are esteemed
a more honorable bearing than fish, and wild and ravenous birds
than tame ones. When their bills and feet are of a different color
from the rest, they are said to be <em>membered</em>. Birds of prey are
more properly said to be <em>armed</em>. In the blazoning of fowls much
exercised in flight, if the wings be not displayed, they are said to
be borne <em>close</em>, for example, he beareth an eagle, a hawk, or a
swallow, <em>close</em>. Fish are borne different ways, upright, embowed,
extended, endorsed, surmounted of each other, fretted, triangled.
Those borne feeding should be termed <em>devouring</em>. Those borne
directly upright are termed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hauriant</i>, and those borne traverse the
escutcheon, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naiant</i>.</p>

<p>To historify, in heraldry, is to explain the history of a coat of
arms, its origin, and the changes it has undergone. If the herald
is to explain a bearing historically, he must show that this figure is
the proper emblem of the family or country. He derives, for
instance, from historical sources, the proof that the double-headed
eagle of the Roman king was first introduced in the beginning of
the fourteenth century, under Albert I., and that previously, from
the time of Otho II., the royal eagle had but one head; that the
three leopards in the English arms were first derived in 1127, under
Henry I., from the Norman house.&mdash;The marshalling of arms consists
in the preparation of new escutcheons. In this matter, the
herald either follows the orders of a sovereign, or he invents the
idea, and makes the plan of the escutcheon according to his own
judgment, or he composes a new escutcheon from several coats of
arms.</p>


<h3>DIFFERENT KINDS OF ARMS.</h3>

<p>In heraldic science, arms are distinguished by different names,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to denote the causes of their being borne, such as <em>arms of dominion</em>,
of <em>pretension</em>, of <em>concession</em>, of <em>community</em>, of <em>patronage</em>, of <em>family</em>,
of <em>alliance</em>, of <em>succession</em>, and of <em>assumption</em>. Those of <em>dominion</em>
and <em>sovereignty</em> are those which emperors, kings, and sovereign
states constantly bear, being, as it were, annexed to the territories,
kingdoms, and provinces they possess. Thus there are the arms of
England, of France, of the United States, &amp;c. Arms of <em>pretension</em>
are those of kingdoms, provinces, or territories, to which a prince or
lord has some claim, and which he adds to his own, although such
kingdoms or territories are possessed by another prince or lord.
Arms of <em>concession</em>, or <em>augmentation of honor</em>, are entire arms, as the
fortress of Gibraltar on the escutcheon of Lord Heathfield. Arms of
<em>community</em> belong to bishoprics, cities, companies, &amp;c. Arms of
<em>patronage</em>, to governors of provinces, lords of manors, &amp;c. Arms of
<em>family</em> are the property of individuals; and it is criminal in any persons
not of the family to assume them. Arms of <em>alliance</em> show the
union of families and individuals. Arms of <em>succession</em> are taken up,
by those who inherit certain estates, manors, &amp;c., either by will,
entail, or donation, and which they impale or quarter with their
own. This multiplies the titles of some families from necessity,
and not from ostentation. Arms of <em>assumption</em>, or <em>assumptive arms,</em>
are taken up by the caprice or fancy of persons who assume them
without a legal title. They are also such as a man of his proper
right may assume, with the approbation of his sovereign and of the
king of arms.</p>


<h3>PARTS OF A COAT OF ARMS.</h3>

<p>The parts of arms are the escutcheon, the tinctures, charges, and
ornaments. Heralds distinguish nine different points in escutcheons,
in order to determine exactly the positions of the bearing they
are charged with, as in the figure.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/image03.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A, dexter chief; B, precise middle chief; C,
sinister chief; D, honor point; E, fess point;
F, nombril point; G, dexter base; H, precise
middle base; I, sinister base. The <em>tinctures</em>
mean the variable hue common both to the
shields and their bearings; and there are seven
tinctures&mdash;yellow or gold, expressed by dots;
white or argent; red, by perpendicular lines;
blue or azure, by horizontal lines; purple, by diagonal
lines from right to left; green, by the
same from left to right; black by horizontal and
perpendicular lines crossing; and orange and blood colors are expressed
by diagonal lines crossing each other. The charges are
the emblems occupying the field of the escutcheon, or any part of
it. All charges are distinguished by the name of <em>honorable ordinaries</em>,
<em>sub-ordinaries</em>, and <em>common charges</em>. Honorable ordinaries,
the principal charges in heraldry, are made of lines only, which,
according to their disposition and form, receive different names.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Sub-ordinaries are ancient heraldic figures frequently used in coats
of arms, and which are distinguished by terms appropriated to each
of them. Common charges are composed of natural, artificial,
and even imaginary things, such as stars, animals, trees, ships, &amp;c.
The ornaments that accompany or surround escutcheons were
introduced to denote the birth, dignity, or office of the person to
whom the arms appertain. They are used both by clergy and
laity. Those most in use are of ten sorts; namely, crowns, coronets,
mitres, helmets, mantlings, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapeaux</i>, wreaths, crests, scrolls,
and supporters. The crest is the highest part of the ornaments of
a coat of arms. It is called <em>crest</em> from the Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crista</i>, which
signifies a comb or tuft, such as many birds have upon their heads,
as the peacock, &amp;c. Crests were anciently marks of great honor,
because they were worn only by heroes of great valor and high
rank, that they might be the better distinguished in an engagement,
and thereby rally their men if dispersed. They are at present considered
as mere ornaments. The scroll is an ornament usually
placed below the shield and supporters, containing a motto or
sentence, alluding to the bearing or to the bearer's name.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The following account of the Ratification of the Constitution of the United States by
the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts convened at Boston on the 9th day
of January, 1788, and continued until the 7th of February, was printed in the Massachusetts
Gazette of Feb. 8th, 1788, published by John Wincoll Allen of Boston. It is here inserted
as a historical document of those times that tried men's souls, which will, we think, be read
with deep interest by those of the present generation. In this way, too, it will be preserved,
as it should be, for posterity. It is printed as we find it in the Gazette, with only the addition
of the names of the towns, in which the individuals of the Convention resided. Of the Convention,
John Hancock was President, William Cushing, Vice-President, and George Richards
Minot, Secretary.]</p></div>


<p>With the highest satisfaction we announce to the publick, that the
Convention of this commonwealth, on Wednesday last, at five o'clock,
P. M. <em>ASSENTED TO</em> the CONSTITUTION, proposed by the late
federal Convention. On this pleasing event, WE DO HEARTILY
congratulate the publick, and do express our sincere wishes, that the
general joy which it has diffused through all ranks of citizens, may be
an auspicious omen of the superiour advantages which will undoubtedly
result from the establishment of such a federal government as
this constitution provides.</p>

<p>Immediately on the news of this joyful decision being announced,
the bells in every publick building in this metropolis began to ring, and
continued to sound the glad tydings for two hours. At sun set the
Convention adjourned: after which, a multitude of people, from all
quarters, moved into State-Street, where they manifested the joy they
felt from this event, by incessant tokens of approbation, and loud
huzzas. The bells of the North church continued to chime harmonious
peals of gratulations the whole night, and part of the next day.
Illuminations were made and other insignia of joy exhibited.</p>

to the orders of the day, were as follows, viz.</p>

<p>The open, manly and honourable conduct of the gentlemen who
composed the minority, in the great question on Wednesday, taken in
the honourable convention, was very different from the turbulent
opposers of the constitution in Pennsylvania, who, not content with
their declamatory and odious protest against its adoption, are now
endeavouring to involve their country in all the horrours of a civil
war, by exciting tumult and insurrection. On the vote of adoption
being declared,</p>

<p>Honourable mr. <span class="smcap">White</span> rose, and said, that notwithstanding he had
opposed the adoption of the constitution, upon the idea that it would
endanger the liberties of his country, yet, as a majority had seen fit to
adopt it, he should use his utmost exertions to induce his constituents
to live in peace under, and cheerfully submit to it.</p>

<p>He was followed by mr. <span class="smcap">Widgery</span>, who said, that he should return
to his constituents, and inform them, that he had opposed the adoption
of this constitution, but that he had been overruled, and that he had
been carried by a majority of wise and understanding men: that he
should endeavour to sow the seeds of union and peace among the people
he represented&mdash;and that he hoped, and believed, that no person
would wish for, or suggest the measure of a PROTEST; for, said he,
we must consider that this body is as full a representation of the
people, as can be conceived.&mdash;&mdash; After expressing his thanks for the
civility which the inhabitants of this town have shewn to the convention,
and declaring, as his opinion, that they had not in the least influenced
the decision; he concluded by saying he should support, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
much as in him lay, the constitution, and believed, as this state had
adopted it, not only 9, but the whole 13, would come into the measure.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Whitney</span> said, that though he had been opposed to the
constitution, he should support it as much as if he had voted for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooley</span>, (<em>Amherst</em>) said, that he endeavoured to govern himself
by the principles of reason, that he was directed to vote against the
adoption of the constitution, and that in so doing, he had not only
complied with his direction, but had acted according to the dictates of
his own conscience; but that as it has been agreed to by a majority,
he should endeavour to convince his constituents of the propriety of its
adoption.</p>

<p>Doctor <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>, also said, he had uniformly opposed the constitution,
that he found himself fairly beat, and expressed his determination to
go home, and endeavour to infuse a spirit of harmony and love, among
the people.</p>

<p>Other gentlemen expressed their inclination to speak, but it growing
late, the convention adjourned to Thursday morning, at ten o'clock.</p>

<p><em>Let this be told to the honour of Massachusetts; to the reputation of her
citizens, as men willing to acquiesce in that republican principle, of submitting
to the decision of a majority.</em></p>

<p>Yesterday, A. M. the Convention met, according to adjournment,
when a vote was passed for proceeding in procession to the state-house,
and there to declare the ratification of the FEDERAL CONSTITUTION,
which that honourable body, on Wednesday last, by a
majority of NINETEEN assented to, in behalf of the commonwealth
of Massachusetts. About 12 o'clock, the procession moved from their
place of session, preceded by the honourable vice-president of the
Convention. His excellency the president being seated in an elegant
vehicle, was drawn by THIRTEEN patriotick and publick spirited
MECHANICKS, who thus expressed their love and respect for a man
who ever loved and respected his country.</p>

<p>The procession having arrived at the state-house, entered the senate-chamber,
from which his excellency the president, the vice-president,
secretary, high-sheriff of the county of Suffolk, and other respectable
characters, went out upon the balcony of the state-house, from whence
his excellency the president addressed the multitude who had assembled
below, in a short speech, preparatory to what they were about to
hear declared. The high-sheriff then declared the federal constitution
adopted and ratified by the Convention of the commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>After which the whole assembly testified their approbation by the
loudest huzzas.</p>

<p>An elegant repast being provided for the occasion in the senate-chamber,
the Convention, and a great number of other gentlemen,
partook thereof, and exhibited such marks of satisfaction, as fully
evinced, that this joyful event would tend to give vigour and energy
to our future continental administrations. After dinner the following
toasts were drank, viz.</p>

<p>1. His excellency the president and convention of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>2. The president and members of the late continental convention.</p>

<p>3. The states that have adopted the federal constitution.</p>

<p>4. A speedy accession to the union by those states who are yet to
deliberate upon the proposed constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>5. May the same candour, and liberality, which has so conspicuously
distinguished the minority of Massachusetts, prevail thro' every state
in the union.</p>

<p>6. May the United States of America be as distinguished for their
increase in agriculture, arts and manufactures, as they are for their
attachment to justice and the liberties of mankind.</p>

<p>7. The great and magnanimous ally of the United States of America&mdash;his
most Christian majesty.</p>

<p>8. The United Netherlands.</p>

<p>9. May the States of America be the asylum of every distressed son
of liberty, throughout the world.</p>

<p>10. May the flag of American commerce be displayed in every
quarter of the globe.</p>

<p>11. May the landholders of America soon experience the happy
effects intended by the proposed constitution.</p>

<p>12. May the nations of the world, who would be our rivals in trade,
soon find their disappointment in the energy of our councils.</p>

<p>13. May peace, liberty, and safety, be the perpetual birthright of an
American.</p>

<p>It seems that the joy which the adoption of the proposed constitution
has diffused, is not only general, but sincere and grateful.&mdash;The
rising sun of yesterday's morn, by its brightness and refulgent beams,
seemed to break forth, from the dusky horizon, with uncommon grandeur,
partaking, as it were, of the joy in which an event so propitious
immersed the souls of the people. The bells of all the churches, &amp;c. in
town, began ringing at early dawn, and continued, most of them without
intermission, thro' the day, and part of last evening.</p>

<p>The hardy sons of Neptune, seemed not to be insensible of the
importance of this great event; for having procured a boat, which they
fixed on a sled, they continued to draw it through the town till near
the close of the day, frequently huzzaing, and loudly exulting in the
anticipation of reviving and flourishing commerce. In the boat was
displayed the flag of the United States, and musick, which kept continually
playing.</p>

<p>In a cart, drawn by five horses, the British flag was displayed, and
insulted by numbers placed in the cart, armed with muskets, who
repeatedly discharged the contents of them through the tattered remnant,
in contempt of that faithless nation, whose exertions have been
unremitted since the peace, to cramp our commerce and obstruct all
our nautical proceedings.</p>

<p>Repeated marks of joy were exhibited during the course of the day
by the lovers and well wishers of our country, but we believe none
will exceed the exhibition which is to take place this day, as will
appear by the following</p>

<p class="center lsp">NOTICE</p>

<p class="pfs80 lsp">TO THE TRADESMEN.</p>

<p>THE COMMITTEE of MECHANICKS appointed at their meeting
the 7th. ult. present their compliments to the several TRADESMEN,
MECHANICKS, and ARTIZANS of every description in the
town of Boston, and request their attendance at Faneuil Hall, this
morning, at NINE o'clock, in order to form and proceed in GRAND<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
PROCESSION therefrom, to testify their approbation of the ratification
of the Federal Constitution, by the Convention of this commonwealth
the 6th instant.</p>

<p>They recommend that the procession be formed as follows&mdash;First,
a plough, drawn by a horse, with husbandmen carrying proper utensils&mdash;Then
the tradesmen, &amp;c. of the town, each with some tool, decorated;
to proceed by trades; each trade with one person at its head.
With the ship-builders, &amp;c. will be a boat, drawn by horses, properly
manned. They request that the procession may be as full as possible;
that the several drummers, fifers, and other musicians in the town, will
join the procession, with their instruments.</p>

<p>The rout of the procession will be mentioned at the Hall.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER" id="LETTER"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LETTER OF CHIEF-JUSTICE SARGEANT OF MASSACHUSETTS.</a></h2>
    </div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The following are extracts from a letter of Judge Sargeant to the Hon. Joseph Badger
of Gilmanton, N. H., who was a Delegate to the Convention of that state for the adoption
of the Federal Constitution.]</p></div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>I make no doubt but you have carefully compared y<sup>e</sup> old confederation with y<sup>e</sup> new
constitution and I wish you to review them again. Can there be such a thing as Government
without Power? What is advice, recommendation, or requisition? It is not
Government.&mdash;Congress has a right to raise an army, to make war and Peace, of
entering into Treaties and alliances to borrow money and appropriate y<sup>e</sup> same&mdash;to
ascertain y<sup>e</sup> sums necessary to be raised for y<sup>e</sup> Service of y<sup>e</sup> United States&mdash;to emit
bills of credit&mdash;to build and equip a navy, and to make requisitions on y<sup>e</sup> states for
their quota of men, to Cloath, arm and equip them. But who will lend Congress
Money when they have not Power to raise a Single Shilling to repay them? Who
will take their bills of Credit when every Body knows they can never redeem them?
Who will enlist into their army when Congress has no money to pay them a Bounty or
their wages or find them in Provisions? Who will build and equip a navy for them
without money? Who will trouble themselves about Congress' making war or Peace
when they can't command a Shilling to support a war? To what Purpose is it to
appropriate money when they can't get it?&mdash;What end does it answer for other
nations to make treaties and alliances with Congress when any one State by its obstinacy,
fraud or some Paltry private interest may defeat y<sup>e</sup> treaty or by main force break
through it?</p>

<p>What good end will be answered by ascertaining y<sup>e</sup> Sums necessary to be raised
when thirteen independent Legislatures are to judge whether those sums are necessary
or not and whether they will raise them or not and if one State won't raise their <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'quotâ'">quota</ins>,
y<sup>e</sup> other states are more than foolish, they are distracted if they raise theirs.&mdash;What
effect will a requisition on y<sup>e</sup> states for raising, cloathing, arming, and equipping their
quotas of men have, when y<sup>e</sup> 13 Legislatures are left to judge of y<sup>e</sup> expediency, or necessity
of this equipment, whether they are not charged above their proportion&mdash;whether
it won't do as well sometime hence? What security is it possible to have under such a
Government? A Government without energy, without power. Zeal and enthusiasm
carried us thro' y<sup>e</sup> last war without any Government till March 1781, when y<sup>e</sup> Confederation
was compleated and then we hobbled along 21 months longer under it until
peace took place, and since y<sup>e</sup> Peace, Requisitions from Congress have had no more effect
than y<sup>e</sup> Pope's bulls wou'd have had. The old Confederation is just y<sup>e</sup> same to y<sup>e</sup>
United States as a people, as a milk and water diet wou'd be to a labouring man, both
wou'd grow weaker and weaker till they were not able to crawl. Nothing ever gave us
any respectability abroad but y<sup>e</sup> readiness and chearfulness with which we complied
with all y<sup>e</sup> recommendations of Congress when we had no Government at all. That enabled
us to form treaties with other nations, to hire money, and their hatred to Great Britain
engaged them to join in y<sup>e</sup> war against her. The nations in Europe discovered this
weakness long before we did. Great Britain for 5 years has refused to make any Treaty
of commerce with us, has shut all her Ports against our shipping, while our Ports are
filled with their shipping and seamen and are picking up our seamen for their employ&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
bring their Produce and manufactures to us to buy but won't let us carry our
own to them. They have embarrass'd our commerce with other nations by setting
y<sup>e</sup> Algerines upon our shipping and thereby obliged us to give 5 per Cent. to them for
insurance against the Algerines&mdash;all this while we have not had y<sup>e</sup> power to retalliate
upon them in one Single Article. The other Powers viz: France, Holland, Spain and
Portugal have now taken y<sup>e</sup> hint and are imposing duties upon our Produce and Manufactures
to y<sup>e</sup> great encouragement of their own and discouragement of ours, and we
can't make any Regulations to counterwork them. Massachusetts some years ago took
y<sup>e</sup> lead and made some very advantageous Regulations. New Hampshire followed, and
Rhode Island adopted a small part. Soon y<sup>e</sup> People in New Hampshire grew restive
and obliged y<sup>e</sup> Government to repeal y<sup>e</sup> same. Rhode Island followed and Massachusetts
was obliged to follow them, so that you see what a rope of sand we are. This
conduct of y<sup>e</sup> European nations will in time, if it produces good Government, prove of
eminent advantage to us. They drained us of almost all our Cash. This put People
upon being industrious and frugal. Industry has occasioned great improvements in
agriculture and in manufactures. The first has rendered Provisions plenty and so
cheap that we sell them to almost all nations. The latter has supplied us with many
necessaries which we used to send cash for, and we remitted to other nations pay for
what necessaries we wanted. Frugality has prevented us from sending our Cash
abroad for many Superfluities which we can do as well or perhaps better without; so
that now it is an undoubted fact that y<sup>e</sup> exports from America greatly exceed y<sup>e</sup> imports;
consequently Cash may now become as plenty as it wou'd be best it shou'd be.</p>

<p>The old Confederation without Power or Energy destroyed y<sup>e</sup> Credit of y<sup>e</sup> United
States. The scarcity of Cash, and y<sup>e</sup> embarrassments of y<sup>e</sup> Government, for want of
some fixed System of finance has destroyed y<sup>e</sup> credit of y<sup>e</sup> individual States&mdash;different
Tender acts in different States, different sorts of paper money in different States, (for
almost all y<sup>e</sup> States have either paper money or tender acts,) have destroyed private
Credit; so that we are now as a people and as individuals totally without either public
or private Credit. Under these circumstances money never can circulate in plenty, let
y<sup>e</sup> advantages for importing it be what they may&mdash;</p>

<p>Is it now possible for a Government, under these disadvantages, whether it be continental
or particular, to support itself any length of time? Will not private industry be
discouraged? Can such a Government protect y<sup>e</sup> industrious from y<sup>e</sup> hands of invaders
or y<sup>e</sup> more savage hands of violence among ourselves? Anarchy will soon rear its
head and y<sup>e</sup> Tyranny of some ambitious Demagogue will soon tread on its heels.
Suppose for a moment y<sup>e</sup> General Court of New Hampshire or Massachusetts were to
agree that such a sum of money was necessary to be raised for y<sup>e</sup> building and maintaining
of a colledge for supporting schools in different Parts, for supporting ministers,
for encouraging y<sup>e</sup> Iron manufactory, y<sup>e</sup> manufactory of cloath, for repairing y<sup>e</sup> highways,
for training and disciplining y<sup>e</sup> militia, and procuring a stock of guns and ammunition
and building forts for y<sup>e</sup> defence of y<sup>e</sup> State and then send a recommendation to
y<sup>e</sup> several towns desiring them to raise their quota of that sum, being so much.</p>

<p>Wou'd not this be a laughable way of raising money for y<sup>e</sup> public exigences? One
town wou'd say there was no need of building a Colledge; others wou'd say there is
no need of Schools or ministers; let them that work Iron and cloath get their own
pay; our highways will do well enough without repairs; y<sup>e</sup> militia are good gunners
already, there is no need of forts, and there is no war at hand, and we can do without
Guns and ammunition a little longer; besides all they have rated our town too high.
Wou'd not this be y<sup>e</sup> common language? A precious little money wou'd be raised, I
trow. Let me ask, if y<sup>e</sup> People in our town meetings are competent Judges of y<sup>e</sup> necessity
and advantage of raising money for these purposes? You will instantly answer
me, no not one in six. Can they have large and extensive views of y<sup>e</sup> interest, of y<sup>e</sup> essential
and important interests of y<sup>e</sup> whole state? No, perhaps, not one, thô many of
them when they had met with other persons from all parts of y<sup>e</sup> state, and had freely
conversed with them might be good Judges afterwards. How absurd and impolitic then
is it to trust y<sup>e</sup> great affairs and interests of a continent, 1500 miles long and 1000 miles
wide to y<sup>e</sup> determination of 2600 men deputed from some little spots of 6 miles square
y<sup>e</sup> greatest part of whom never went further than y<sup>e</sup> next market town perhaps, or at
y<sup>e</sup> outside to y<sup>e</sup> shire town of y<sup>e</sup> state and never expects to go again after his year is
up, or if he does, it is only to get his 3<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> a day without labour or at y<sup>e</sup> most to have
y<sup>e</sup> honour of saving a small Tax upon his own town&mdash;and these men are not to meet
altogether where they might, if disposed, get y<sup>e</sup> necessary information to form a Judgment
by,&mdash;but in thirteen different places where they have different interests, different
leaders and different information. How much more ridiculous is it then, that all these
men are to determine of y<sup>e</sup> necessity of Peace or War&mdash;of y<sup>e</sup> sums of Money necessary
to be raised, of y<sup>e</sup> best and easiest mode of raising it thro' all y<sup>e</sup> states, regulating
y<sup>e</sup> value of money thro' all y<sup>e</sup> states, of defining and punishing Piracies and felonies on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>y<sup>e</sup> high seas and of Offences against y<sup>e</sup> law of nations&mdash;when it is necessary and proper
to grant Letters of Marque and reprisal&mdash;what are y<sup>e</sup> rights and duties of Ambassadors,
Consuls and public ministers, what are proper rules respecting captures where
other nations are concerned with us in y<sup>e</sup> capture or are interested in y<sup>e</sup> vessel captured,
what regulations of Trade may be carried into effect in other nations so as not to
injure our own commerce. These and a thousand other matters respecting our intercourse
with other nations and other great national concerns, must be determined by
some Body of men with decision and be carried into effect too. How preposterous is it
then for us to think of going on under y<sup>e</sup> old Confederation where y<sup>e</sup> several states or
some of them wou'd hiss any Law that might be proposed on those matters out of Doors.</p>

<p>Now let us consider y<sup>e</sup> new Constitution. Are there any objects, of Legislation
in this, which were not left to y<sup>e</sup> decision of Congress under y<sup>e</sup> old Articles?
Very few, save that of Regulating commerce with foreign nations for want of which
we have suffered enough already&mdash;also to form a rule for naturalization Laws
about Bankruptcies&mdash;fix y<sup>e</sup> standard of weights and measures&mdash;to promote y<sup>e</sup> progress
of arts and Sciences&mdash;to prevent counterfeiting y<sup>e</sup> Securities and current coin
of y<sup>e</sup> states, to provide for organizing, arming, disciplining and calling forth y<sup>e</sup> militia
on necessary occasions; to exercise exclusive Jurisdiction over 10 miles square of land
where Congress may sit, if so much is ceded to them by any state to their satisfaction
and such other places where continental arsenals are kept. Our People are taught y<sup>e</sup>
necessity of this provision for if a man of less penetration and decision had been in y<sup>e</sup>
chair y<sup>e</sup> year before last&mdash;they would have lost their most useful and costly magazine.
Is it not reasonable that these matters shou'd be done with uniformity thro' y<sup>e</sup> states?
Can these great objects ever be accomplished without making laws to bind all persons
in y<sup>e</sup> Jurisdiction? Who are to make those Laws but y<sup>e</sup> Representatives chosen by
y<sup>e</sup> People at large every two years, and where an equal representation is provided for,
and a Senate chosen by y<sup>e</sup> state Legislatures, one third of which are to be chosen every
two years. When Laws are made they are nonsensical unless they can be carried into
execution; therefore it is necessary somebody shou'd have a Power of determining
when they are broken, and to decree y<sup>e</sup> forfieture in consequence of such breach. This
shows y<sup>e</sup> necessity of y<sup>e</sup> Judicial Power&mdash;and an executive with y<sup>e</sup> necessary officers
are requisite for carrying those decrees into execution&mdash;and without all this y<sup>e</sup> whole
parade of making laws wou'd be idle.</p>

<p>That these parts, y<sup>e</sup> Judicial and executive, shou'd be appointed by congress is necessary
in order that y<sup>e</sup> proceedings may be uniform and to prevent one state from conniving
at or disregarding y<sup>e</sup> laws made for y<sup>e</sup> benefit of y<sup>e</sup> whole. If they are to raise
money they must have officers to collect it. These must be appointed by Congress or
such men will be appointed by particular states as will shew y<sup>e</sup> most favour&mdash;and
look thro' y<sup>e</sup> whole, I believe you will not find a Single Power given but what would
maim y<sup>e</sup> constitution if it was left out. Perhaps it may be said this will be an expensive
Government. The Legislative will not be more expensive, if so much, as y<sup>e</sup> present
congress for after they have got matters a going properly, they may be at home half
their time. The other officers must be paid it is true, but when we consider y<sup>e</sup> advantages
of a steady uniform Government with proper energy, I believe we shall find y<sup>e</sup>
Benefits purchased at a cheap rate. Perhaps some may say that this annihilates our
own state Governments, and our own Legislatures will have nothing to do; but y<sup>e</sup>
Laws respecting criminal offenders in all cases, except Treason, are subjects for Legislation.
We may increase, lessen, or change punishments for crimes as we think best,
and make any act criminal or pœnal as far as Law can make it so at our pleasure. The
regulating Towns, parishes, Providing ministers, schools, looking after Poor persons, punishing
Idlers, vagabonds &amp;c. &amp;c. regulating Highways, bridges, fisheries, common fields
&amp;c. are also matters pertaining to y<sup>e</sup> General court&mdash;but above all y<sup>e</sup> great rules for regulating
inheritances, descent of estates, Partition of them, last wills and Testaments,
executors, Administrators, and Guardians are subjects for our own Legislation&mdash;y<sup>e</sup>
appointment of all courts, and y<sup>e</sup> rules of Proceeding in them and of determining all
controversies between our own citizens, Rules of Legitimacy, marriage and divorce
and in fine all matters not expressly given to congress are still to be the subjects of our
own Legislation to be carried into Effect by our own courts and officers. Over what
things does y<sup>e</sup> constitution give congress a Power only those of great national concern,
which require a large comprehensive view and which, Heaven knows, our Houses of
R-p-s-t-tives were never capable of comprehending or of judging whether they were
acting right or wrong.&mdash;I write very freely to you, without any reserve. Y<sup>e</sup> regard
I have for my Children, my Kinsmen, my friends, my Neighbours, Posterity and my
country, makes me bless God that those objects are likely for ever to be taken out of
such hands, two thirds of whom were never from their fire side before, and never comprehended
in their view more than their own farms and their own little private interest.
I cou'd write a volume on this subject, but thus much must suffice for y<sup>e</sup> present. I
believe you are tired now as well as your affectionate</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exeter.</span> <em>"Exeter New Church," afterwards called "The Second Church of
Christ in Exeter."</em><a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> A considerable number of the members of the First Church
seceded, and "embodied into a New Church, on a day of Fasting and Prayer,
June 7, 1744." There is an error in several publications, giving 1748 as the
date of the formation of that church. This error is found on the monumental
stone of Rev. Daniel Rogers, in the graveyard, in Exeter. It is not strange that,
in so long an inscription, there should have been, through inadvertency, an
omission, by the engraver, or in his copy, of the word <em>installed</em>, immediately
after the name. The words, <em>Pastor of a church gathered in Exeter</em>, should have
been marked by a parenthesis. The inscription on the gravestone was copied
by Alden, into his Collections, and thus currency has been, unintentionally,
given to the error. Original documents show the facts in the case.</p>

<p>The causes of the <em>secession</em>, which issued in the establishment of a New
Church in Exeter, were of a religious nature, but the presentation of them does
not come within the scope of this work, and besides, we have not space for their
discussion.</p>

<p>The <em>Rev. Daniel Rogers</em> was born in Ipswich, Ms., in 1707, and graduated H.
C. 1725. He received ordination, without a pastoral charge, by a council, which
met at York, July 13, 1742. The ministers of the council were Rev. Messrs.
Jeremiah Wise of Berwick, Me.; Nicholas Gilman of Durham, N. H.; John
Rogers of Kittery, (now Eliot,) Me.; and Samuel Moody of York, Me. Rev.
Daniel Rogers "had been many years a tutor in Harvard College, was a pious
faithful minister of Jesus Christ, and a worthy son of Rev. John Rogers, pastor
of the first church in Ipswich, who died, Dec. 28, 1745, in his 80th year. <em>He</em>
was a son of John Rogers of the same place, a physician, and preacher of
God's word, and President of Harvard College, who died, July 2, 1684, aged
54 years. <em>He</em> was eldest son of the Rev. Nathaniel Rogers, who came from
England, in 1636, settled at Ipswich, colleague pastor with the Rev. Nathaniel
Ward, and died, July 2, 1655, aged 57 years. <em>He</em> was son of the Rev. John
Rogers, a famous minister of God's word at Dedham, in England, who died Oct.
18, 1639, aged 67 years. <em>He</em> was grandson of John Rogers of London, Prebendary
of St Paul's, Vicar of St. Sepulchre's, and Reader of Divinity, who was
burnt at Smithfield, Feb. 14, 1555, first martyr in Queen Mary's reign." [<cite>Monumental
Stone; Alden's Epitaphs.</cite>] Rev. Daniel Rogers died, Dec. 9, 1785, aged
79. When the Covenant of the 2nd church was adopted, it was signed by 30
males and 11 females. During Mr. Rogers' ministry, 22 males and 39 females
were added. It is well known, that Mr. Whitefield preached a few times at
Exeter. During the last week in September, 1770, he preached four times in
Portsmouth. On Saturday morning he rode to Exeter, and preached to a large
concourse of people, assembled in the open air. It was his last sermon. In
the afternoon, he rode to Newburyport, where he died the next morning, on the
30th of September. He was interred on the 2nd of October. Of his pall bearers
were Rev. Dr. Haven of Portsmouth, and Rev. Daniel Rogers of Exeter.
"When the corpse was placed at the foot of the pulpit close to the vault, the
Rev. Daniel Rogers made a very affecting prayer, and openly confessed that
under God, he owed his conversion to that man of God whose precious remains
now lay before them. Then he cried out, O my father, my father! Then
stopped and wept, as though his heart would break; and the people weeping
all through the place. Then he recovered, and finished his prayer and sat down
and wept." [<cite>Dr. Gillie's Memoirs of Whitefield.</cite>]</p>

<p>The <em>Rev. Joseph Brown</em> was educated at Lady Huntingdon's Seminary, and
was settled in the ministry at Epping, Essex, England, until he came to this
country. When dismissed at Exeter, he removed to Deer Isle, Me., where he
was installed, 1804, and where he died, Sept. 13, 1819, aged 57. From the
death of Mr. Rogers to the close of Mr. Brown's ministry, in the 2nd church in
Exeter, there were added fourteen males, and twenty-four females. During
Mr. Brown's residence at Deer Isle, he was engaged in soliciting aid for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
charitable enterprise. For that purpose he called on some of the people of
Portsmouth. They received him kindly, and only objected that they had just
been doing for <em>this</em>,&mdash;<em>that</em>,&mdash;and <em>the other</em> objects of benevolence. His reply
is worthy of notice for the sentiment it contains: "I love to come among these
<em>have been doing</em> folks." On the church book are the baptisms of his son Americus,
in 1793; his son Charles Moulson, in 1794; and his son Daniel Rogers,
in 1797. Rev. Charles M. Brown has been a zealous and useful Seamen's
Chaplain. From the close of Mr. Brown's ministry, in the 2nd church in
Exeter, to 1802, there were admitted three males, and nine females. There is
then a chasm in the records, till Sept. 18, 1823, when a majority of the members
remaining in Exeter, and they females, met at the house of Mrs. Martha
Poor. Their proceedings are regularly entered in the church book, the last
date being May 22, 1824.</p>

<p>They had no pastor after Mr. Brown. For a few years they had occasional
preaching. They never formally disbanded; but most of them united, or mingled
in the observance of religious ordinances, with other churches. Their
meeting-house stood where Maj. Waddy V. Cobb's house now stands, on Front
street.</p>

<p><em>A New Church was formed Dec. 24, 1813</em>, which is now styled "<em>The Second
Church in Exeter</em>." The ministers invited on the occasion by Letters Missive
from "several members of the Religious Society, in the Upper Congregational
Society in Exeter," were the Rev. Messrs. Porter of Rye, Holt of Epping,
Abbot of Hampton Falls, Webster of Hampton, and French of North Hampton.</p>

<p>Mr. Hosea Hildreth, professor of mathematics and natural philosophy, in the
Academy, and who was also a preacher, supplied the pulpit for some time. Mr.
Hildreth was ordained in Gloucester, Ms., in 1825; and installed in Westborough,
Ms., in 1834. He died in Sterling, Ms., his native place, July 10,
1835, aged 53.</p>

<p><em>Rev. Isaac Hurd</em>, pastor of the present Second Church, was born in Charlestown,
Ms., Dec. 7, 1785; graduated H. C. 1806; studied theology with Rev.
Dr. Osgood of Medford, Ms.; and afterwards at Divinity Hall, in Edinburgh,
Scotland; and commenced preaching in the city of London. He was ordained
pastor of the First Church in Lynn, Ms., Sept. 15, 1813, resigned May 22,
1816, and was, by the unanimous invitation of "The Second Congregational
Church, in Exeter," installed their pastor, Sept. 11, 1817. The sermon was
preached by the Rev. Daniel Dana, D. D., of Newburyport, from 2 Tim. i: 7.</p>

<p>The father of Mr. Hurd was Joseph Hurd, Esq., of Charlestown, Ms., whose
brother, Isaac Hurd, M. D., graduated at H. C. in 1776, and was a physician
of celebrity, in Concord, Ms. The Rev. Mr. Hurd married, March 16, 1819,
Mrs. Elisabeth Emery of Exeter, whose maiden name was Folsom. One of
the sons of Mr. Hurd died in early childhood. His other son, Francis Parkman
Hurd, graduated at H. C. in 1839, and received the degree of M. D. from the
University of Pennsylvania, in 1845.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gosport</span>, or Star Island, is one of a cluster of eight small islands usually
called The Isles of Shoals, composed of beds of rocks, partly covered with
soil. They are about nine miles from Portsmouth Light House, and twenty-one
from Newburyport Lights. Five of these islands are within the limits of
Maine. Of these, Hog Island is the largest of the whole group, and contains
about 350 acres. Of the three in New Hampshire, Gosport, or Star Island,
formerly called Appledore, is the largest, and contains 150 acres. White
Island, on which the Light House is located, is only one acre. These islands
were visited, as early as 1614, by the celebrated navigator, John Smith, who
gave them his own name; but they have long been called "The Isles of
Shoals." They invited settlement, merely by the advantages they furnished
for fishery. This business was prosperous, for about a century, previous to the
American Revolution. The population varied from 300 to 600, employing a
number of schooners and other craft. A meeting-house, previous to 1641, was
erected on Hog Island, where the people from the several islands used to
assemble. There was also a Court House on the same island. At a subsequent
period, a meeting-house was built on Star Island, where the greater part of the
inhabitants have resided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Rev. Joseph Hull</em> came from England, and settled in Weymouth, Ms., in
1635. He resigned in 1639, and afterwards preached at the Isles of Shoals.
He is mentioned as "of the Isle of Sholes," by Dr. Cotton Mather, in his list of
the first class of New England ministers. [<cite>Magnalia</cite>, Vol. I., B. 3.]</p>

<p><em>Rev. John Brock</em> came to New England in 1637. He commenced preaching
in Rowley, and afterward labored, a number of years, at the Shoals. He was
esteemed eminently pious. The celebrated Mr. Mitchel of Cambridge said of
him, "He dwells as near heaven as any man upon earth." Rev. John Allin of
Dedham observed, "I scarce ever knew any man so familiar with the great
God as his dear servant Brock." There were several remarkable coincidences
between Mr. Brock's prayers and providential occurrences afterward. A man,
whose principal property was his fishing-boat, and who had been very serviceable
in conveying to the place of meeting the inhabitants of other islands,
lost his boat in a storm. He lamented his loss to Mr. Brock, who said to him,
"Go home, honest man, I'll mention the matter to the Lord, you'll have your
boat to-morrow." Mr. Brock made the matter a subject of prayer. The next
day the anchor of a vessel fastened upon the boat and drew it up.</p>

<p>The people were persuaded by Mr. Brock to observe one day in each month,
as an extra season of religious exercises. On one occasion, the roughness of
the weather had for several days prevented fishing. On the day of meeting,
the weather was fine, and the men wished the meeting put by. Mr. Brock,
perceiving that they were determined not to attend, said to them, <em>If you will go
away, I say unto you, catch fish if you can. But as for you that will tarry and
worship the Lord Jesus Christ this day, I will pray unto him for you, that you may
take fish till you are weary.</em> Thirty men went away, and five tarried. The
thirty caught but four fishes. The five, who tarried, went out afterward and
took about five hundred.</p>

<p>Mr. Brock continued at the Shoals till 1662, when he removed to Reading,
Ms., where he was settled, as successor of Rev. Samuel Hough, whose widow
he married, and where he continued till his death, in his 68th year. For other
particulars of Mr. Brock see Magnalia, Vol. II., B. 4, and Am. Quar. Reg., Vol.

<p><em>Rev. Samuel Belcher</em>, who graduated H. C. in 1659, was preacher at the Shoals
in 1672. From 1698 to 1711, he was pastor of the 2nd church in Newbury,
which became the 1st in West Newbury. He died in Ipswich, his native place,
Aug. 13, 1714, aged 74. "He was a good scholar, a judicious divine; and a
holy, humble man." [<cite>Am. Quar. Reg.</cite>, Vol. VII., p. 259.]</p>

<p><em>Rev. John Tucke</em> is understood to have been the only pastor ever ordained at
the Shoals. The writer of this article has not been able to ascertain how the
people were supplied, during the forty years immediately preceding the settlement
of Mr. Tucke. Mr. Tucke was the son of <em>John</em>, who was the son of <em>Edward</em>,
who was the son of <em>Robert</em>, who emigrated from Gorlston, Suffolk, Eng.,
about the year 1636, and was among the first settlers in Hampton, N. H. Mr.
Tucke's ordination sermon was preached by Rev. Jabez Fitch of Portsmouth, from
Matt. iv: 19&mdash;<em>I will make you fishers of men.</em> It is said that Mr. Tucke was furnished
with a large library, and was, notwithstanding his isolated situation, extensively
acquainted with the affairs of his times. He was one of the forty-five
ministers, whose attestations, by letter, to the revival in 1743, were published.
His remains rest in Gosport. The following inscription on his monumental
stone, has been considered a just tribute to his memory.</p>

<p>Mr. Tucke married, Nov. 26, 1724, Mary Dole of Hampton, a descendant of
Richard Dole of Newbury.</p>

<p>Rev. John Tucke, son of Mr. Tucke of the Shoals, was born in 1740, graduated
H. C. 1758; ordained at Epsom, Sept. 23, 1761, married, March 4, 1762,
to Mary, daughter of Rev. Samuel Parsons of Rye. Love M., daughter of Mr.
Tucke of Epsom, married Simeon Drake. These last mentioned were the parents
of Samuel G. Drake, M. A., of Boston. Mr. Tucke of Epsom remained in that
place till the time of the Revolution. While on his way to join the army as
Chaplain, he was taken with the small-pox, of which he died in Salem, N. Y.,
Feb. 9, 1777, in the 37th year of his age.</p>

<p>Not long after the death of the Rev. Mr. Tucke of Gosport, the war of the
Revolution commenced. The inhabitants were exceedingly exposed; business
was arrested, and many left the Islands not to return. The population for the
last half century, has varied from 66 to 103. The preachers who have resided
there have also instructed the school, and have been supported in part, by the
inhabitants, and in part by contributions from benevolent societies, and individuals.
Near the beginning of the present century, <em>Rev. Josiah Stevens</em> was located
at the Shoals. There was at that time, a comfortable parsonage house,
and a stone meeting-house, which was also the school-house, on Gosport. Mr.
Stevens was much respected and beloved, and very useful as a minister and
teacher. He was born in Killingworth, Ct., about 1740. In mature age, he removed,
with his wife and five or six children, to Newport, N. H. He aided in
founding the church in that place, and was one of its deacons. He served two
short terms in the Revolutionary war; and was in the battle of Bennington.
A fellow-soldier spake of him, as a man of decided piety, who amidst the bustle
of the camp, was constant in his morning and evening devotions. Immediately
after the adoption of the State Constitution, he received a civil commission, and
transacted much business, as a magistrate. He was often engaged in teaching.
After commencing to preach, he labored for a time in Goshen. His father was
Josiah Stevens. A son of Rev. Mr. Stevens, Maj. Josiah Stevens, was also a
deacon of the church in Newport, where he died, in 1844, aged 81. <em>He</em> was
father of Hon. Josiah Stevens of Concord, who was born in Newport, Jan. 28,
1795, and was in 1838 elected Secretary of State. <em>His</em> eldest son is Josiah.
The Rev. Mr. Stevens died in Gosport, where the following inscription is found
on his gravestone:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In memory of the Rev. Josiah Stevens, a faithful instructor of youth, and pious
minister of Jesus Christ, (supported on this Island, by the Society for propagating the
gospel,) who died, July 2, 1804, aged 64 years.</p></div>

<p><em>Rev. Samuel Sewall</em>, who labored several years as pastor in Edgecomb, Me.,
removed in 1824 to the Isles of Shoals, "being employed by a benevolent
society in Newburyport and vicinity, as a missionary, and continued in this
employment until the time of his death." He died in Rye, N. H., after a short
sickness, March 16, 1826, leaving the character of an exemplary Christian,
and a devoted and useful minister. <em>Rev. Origen Smith</em>, of the Free-will Baptist
denomination, preached there in 1837. Recently, the Society for Propagating
the Gospel have employed <em>Rev. A. Plumer</em> as preacher, and Mrs. Plumer,
as teacher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greenland.</span> It is not ascertained when the church was gathered at Greenland.
It consisted of nineteen members when the <em>Rev. William Allen</em>, their
first minister, was ordained. He was born in Boston, Ms., in 1676, graduated
H. C. in 1703; ordained July 15, 1707; died, Sept. 8, 1760, aged 84. Rev. Dr.
Langdon, in his sermon at the ordination of Mr. Macclintock, as colleague, said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
to the people. "Let not your affections be withdrawn from <em>him</em>, who has spent
his strength in your service; and now, bowing under his infirmities, is no
longer able to perform his public work; but is preparing to leave <em>you</em>, that he
may join the church triumphant. Remember he is still your pastor; and, tho'
he cannot minister to you as formerly, he is still concerned for your spiritual
welfare, pouring out his soul the more earnestly in prayer for you, as he sees the
time of his departure is at hand." During Mr. Allen's ministry 293 were added
to the church. In 1728, forty-four were added; in 1735, thirty; in 1742, thirty;
in 1756, the last year of his active ministry, thirteen. Mrs. Eleanor Allen, his
consort, died Jan. 16, 1734-5, aged 52; "an early convert, eminent for holiness,
prayerfulness, watchfulness, zeal, prudence, weanedness from the world, self-denial,
faithfulness, and charity." Mr. Allen is said to have married, for his
second wife, Elisabeth Weare of Hampton Falls.</p>

<p><em>Rev. Samuel Macclintock, D. D.</em>, second pastor, was a son of Mr. William
Macclintock, who came from the north of Ireland, and settled in Medford, Ms.;
was a respectable farmer, the husband of four wives, the father of nineteen children,
and died aged 90. His third wife accompanied him to this country. She
was the mother of Samuel, who was born at Medford, May 1, 1732. He was
religiously educated, from early childhood. His classical education, which
commenced in the grammar-school, at Medford, was continued under the instruction
of the celebrated Master Minot, at Concord, Ms.; and, afterward, under
the preceptorship of the Rev. Mr. Abercrombie, a clergyman, eminent for piety
and learning, in an Academy, near Northampton, Ms. Mr. Macclintock graduated
at the College of New Jersey, 1751. Before the expiration of his senior year,
he was invited, by Pres. Burr, to accept an appointment to a tutorship, which, on
account of other plans, he declined. He was ordained at Greenland, colleague
with Mr. Allen, Nov. 3, 1756. The strain of Dr. Macclintock's preaching was
evangelical, serious, instructive, plain, and practical; his style manly and nervous;
his delivery solemn and unaffected. His sermons were always the fruit
of close application, and finished with a degree of accuracy, that few attempt,
and fewer attain.</p>

<p>He ardently espoused the cause of his country; and was repeatedly with the
army in the Revolution, in the capacity of Chaplain. Three of his sons fell in
the contest. He had fifteen children by his first marriage, and one by his second.
His last preaching was on the annual Fast, April 19, 1804. He died of
a pulmonic fever on the 27th of the same month. His funeral sermon was
preached by Rev. Dr. Buckminster of Portsmouth, from 1 Cor. iii: 22. The
executor of Dr. Macclintock's will was directed by him, to place only a plain
stone at his grave, for which he had prepared the last sentence of the following
inscription.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To the Memory of Samuel Macclintock, D. D. who died April 27, 1804, in the 72d
year of his age, and the 48th of his ministry. <em>His body rests here in the certain hope of a
resurrection to life and immortality, when Christ shall appear, the second time, to consummate
the great design of his mediatorial kingdom.</em>" [<cite>Alden's Epitaphs; Dr. Buckminster's Serm.</cite>]</p></div>

<p>Dr. Macclintock's publications were, a Sermon on the Justice of God in the
Mortality of Man, 1759; the Artifices of Deceivers, 1770; Herodias, or cruelty
and revenge the effects of unlawful pleasure, 1772; Sermon at the commencement
of the new Constitution in New Hampshire, 1784; Correspondence with
Rev. John Cosens Ogden, 1791; Sermon, The Choice, occasioned by the
drought, the fever, and the prospect of war, 1798; Oration, commemorative of
Washington, 1800. [<cite>Allen's Biog. Dic.; Piscataqua Evan. Mag.</cite> Vol. I.]</p>

<p><em>Rev. James Armstrong Neal</em>, third pastor in Greenland, was a son of John
Neal of Portsmouth, afterward of Londonderry, who married Mary Leavitt of
North Hampton. Their other children were Moses Leavitt, Esq., of Dover,
N. H.; John, superintendent of the Orphan house, Charleston, S. C.; Mary,
wife of Maj. Gershom Cheney, of Rutland, Vt.; Sarah B.; Sophia W., who
married Capt. Samuel F. Leavitt of North Hampton; Joseph, of Hampton;
and Nathaniel P., of New Sharon, Me. Rev. Mr. Neal was born in 1774. He
had a good academical education, and was some years preceptor of a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
ladies' school, in Philadelphia. He was patronized by Rev. Dr. Green, to
whose church he belonged, and under whose direction he commenced his theological
studies. Although he had not been a member of any college, such
were his literary attainments, that Dr. Nesbit, President of Dickinson College,
conferred upon him the degree of M. A. in 1802. Mr. Neal received license
from the Piscataqua Association. He was ordained at Greenland, May 22,
1807. The exercises were, Prayer by Rev. Peter Holt of Epping; Sermon by
Rev. Jesse Appleton of Hampton, from Hag. ii: 6, 7; Ordaining Prayer by
Rev. William Morrison of Londonderry; Charge by Rev. Timothy Upham of
Deerfield; Fellowship by Rev. J. French of North Hampton; Prayer by Rev.
H. Porter of Rye. Mr. Neal possessed popular talents, and died much
regretted, after suffering greatly, from an organic disease of the heart, July 18,
1808, aged 34. He married Christiana Palmer, a lady from Kelso, Scotland.
They had two sons. The oldest, John P., died Nov. 14, 1806, aged 2 years.
Their other son, Joseph Clay Neal, has resided in Philadelphia, and is known
to the public, as the editor of the Philadelphian; author of the Charcoal
Sketches. [<cite>Piscat. Ev. Mag.</cite>; <cite>Alden's Epitaphs</cite>; <cite>Graham's Mag.</cite>]</p>

<p><em>Rev. Ephraim Abbot</em>, fourth pastor in Greenland, was of the Concord branch
of the Abbot family. He was born in New Castle, Me., in 1779. His father
was Benjamin, who was son of Benjamin of Concord, who was son of Thomas,
who was son of George, who settled in Andover, Ms., in 1647, and who is said
to have emigrated from Yorkshire, England. Rev. Mr. Abbot of Greenland
graduated H. C. 1806, and at And. Theo. Sem. 1810, and was ordained at Greenland,
Oct. 27, 1813. The sermon was by Rev. Eliphalet Pearson, LL. D., from
Matt. x: 16. Mr. Abbot married Mary Holyoke, daughter of Dr. Pearson, who,
after he resigned his professorship in the And. Theo. Sem., resided in Mr.
Abbot's family, in Greenland, where he deceased, in 1826. For some account
of Mr. Abbot's missionary labors, before he was settled at Greenland, see "The
New Hampshire Repository," Vol. II., No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. Abbot's health becoming infirm, in consequence of a wound in his side,
and not being able to confine himself entirely to the labors of a pastor, he became
the first preceptor of the Academy in the place, established by George
Bracket, Esq. He resigned his ministry, Oct. 28, 1828. The <em>church</em>, at his
ordination, consisted of nineteen members. During his ministry thirty-seven
were added. He removed to Westford, Ms., and took charge of the Academy
in that place. His second marriage was with Miss Bancroft, daughter of Amos
Bancroft, M. D., of Groton, Ms.</p>

<p><em>Rev. Samuel Wallace Clark</em> was born in Hancock, N. H., Dec. 15, 1795, graduated
D. C. 1823; ordained at Greenland, Aug. 5, 1829. His father, John Clark,
was grandson of Robert Clark, who emigrated from the north of Ireland to Londonderry,
N. H., in company with the early settlers of that place; though not
among the first. Rev. S. W. Clark was the second of ten children, and the
eldest of four sons. His brother, Rev. William Clark, was several years pastor
of the 1st church in Wells, Me., and has since been extensively known, in his
agency for the A. B. C. F. M. Rev. Mr. Clark of Greenland married Frances
M., daughter of Dea. Robert Clark, for many years an elder of the Presbyterian
church, in New Boston. She deceased July 12, 1832, leaving one child, Frances
Wallace. Mr. Clark's second marriage was with Rebecca Elisabeth Howe,
a descendant of the Pilgrim, John Alden. She is a daughter of Josiah Howe,
M. D., of Templeton, and afterwards of Westminster, Ms. The children of Mr.
Clark, by the second marriage, were John Howe, Lucy Barrow, and William
Wallace; the last of whom deceased Aug. 19, 1846.</p>

<p>When Mr. Clark was ordained, his church consisted of twenty-eight members.
In 1846, there were forty communicants.</p>

<p class="center small p2">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Wolcott</span> was the first of the Wolcott Family who settled in New
England. He owned a considerable landed property in his native country,
which he held <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in capite</i>, part of which he sold about the time he left England;
the rest of the estate was sold at sundry times by himself and his descendants;
the last remains were sold since the Declaration of Independence, by Henry
Allen, Esq., of Windsor, who claimed it by female descent. From circumstances
it seems probable that the family are of Saxon origin. Mr. Wolcott, to
avoid the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the English Church, was induced to come
into this country. He first settled at Dorchester, where he continued till 1636,
when he came with the first settlers to the town of Windsor, and with four other
gentlemen, namely, Mr. Ludlow, Mr. Newberry, Mr. Stoughton, and Major Mason,
undertook the settlement of that town, to which they gave the name <em>Dorchester</em>.
The towns of Hartford and Wethersfield were settled the same year, though
the town which is now called Windsor was, upon the first emigration, by far
the most considerable. Previous to this settlement on Connecticut River, one
had been made at Springfield, under the patronage of Mr. Pynchon; and an
earlier settlement, with commercial views, had been made at Saybrook, by Mr.
Fenwick, agent to Lords Say and Seal and Brook. Those who settled on Connecticut
River, in the year 1636, were united with the people of Massachusetts
in religious and civil polity, and seem to have been much under their influence till
1638, when they adopted a civil constitution for themselves, and Mr. Ludlow
was chosen their first Governor, and Mr. Wolcott a magistrate, then called an
Assistant, to which office he was annually chosen till his death, in 1655. His
eldest son Henry was one of the Patentees, whose name is inserted in the
Charter granted by Charles II. Mr. Ludlow went to the West Indies, and
left no posterity in this country. Major Mason, it is said, had no male posterity.
The descendants of the others are well known in Windsor.</p>


<p class="center small p2">GENEALOGY.</p>

<p>Henry Wolcott, Esq., was born A. D. 1578; and on or about the year
1607, married Elisabeth Sanders, who was born in 1589. He lived in
Tolland, near Taunton in Somersetshire, England, till the year 1630,
and then to avoid persecution, came with his family into New England,
and settled at Dorchester. In the year 1636, he went with his
family to Windsor in Connecticut. Mr. Wolcott, Mr. Ludlow, Mr. Newberry,
Mr. Stoughton, and Major Mason, were the five gentlemen that
undertook the settling of the town. Mr. Wolcott was one of the first
magistrates in the Colony of Connecticut; he lived in that post in
Windsor, till he died, May 30, 1655. His wife died July 7, 1655, and
she and her husband lie buried in one tomb in Windsor. Their children
were</p>

<h3 class="large"><a name="THE_PARSONS_FAMILY" id="THE_PARSONS_FAMILY"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE PARSONS FAMILY.</a><a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></h3>


<p>As it respects the <em>origin</em> of the name of Parsons, some have supposed
that it was derived from the word <em>parson</em>, a clerical title, given from
the fact that a clergyman is the principal person in the church. Hence
in law he is termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ecclesiæ persona</i>, and has full possession of all the
rights of a parochial church. The <em>s</em> is added for euphony's sake, or
from the fact that the individual was the parson's son.</p>

<p>Others have derived it from the word <em>parish</em>, as parish-son, meaning
the son of some parish, one supported or educated by the parish.</p>

<p>And others again have supposed that the name is the same with
<em>Person</em>, <em>Peerson</em>, <em>Pierson</em>, and <em>Pearson</em>, modified in the spelling.</p>

<p><em>Peirson</em> or <em>Peerson</em> is derived, according to Camden, from <em>son of
Peter</em> or <em>Peterson</em>, the former coming originally from the French word,
<em>Pierre</em>.</p>

<p>It does not appear that there has ever been any attempt to collect
even the materials for a history of the English family of Parsons, so
far as has come to our knowledge, notwithstanding there have been
many individuals among them of great distinction; as knights, baronets,
and noblemen. Those of the name are, and have been for a long
period, found in several counties; as Devonshire, Buckinghamshire,
Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Prior to 1672, Andrew Parsons, gent., was of Somersetshire, and
Philip Parsons, gent., of Worcestershire. But the earliest record we
have noticed is in</p>

<p>1290. <span class="smcap">Walter</span> was then a resident of Mulso in Ireland. How long
before this he or his ancestors went there we know not. The name is
still extant there, and something above one hundred years ago, Bishop
Gibson remarked, (in his edition of Camden's Britannia,) "The honorable
family of Parsons have been advanced to the dignity of Viscounts,
and more lately, Earls of Ross."</p>

<p>1481. <span class="smcap">Sir John</span> was Mayor of Hereford, who had for his armorial
bearings, <em>Gules, a leopard's head between three crosses patee, fitched in
the foot ar.</em>&mdash;Crest, <em>a halberd headed az. embued gules</em>.</p>

<p>1546. <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, afterwards the noted Jesuit, was born this year, and
died April 18, 1610, a. 64. He appears to have been the first of note of
his family. His father lived near Bridgewater, Eng., at a place called
Netherstoway. Robert was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, and
was early distinguished for his abilities, but being accused of some
irregularities he forsook his country and resided for a time at Antwerp,
Louvain, Padua, Rome, Paris and Valladolid. Becoming a convert to
the Romish faith, he propagated that doctrine with all his ability,
and was no small instrument in stirring up the benighted vassals of
Philip II. to attempt the conquest of his native country. The event
of that attempt will always be viewed with an intensity of interest.</p>

<p>How much Father Parsons had to do in circulating the Pope's bulls
and inflammatory tracts in England at the period of the Armada can
never be known, but from his knowledge of the country, the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and their language, it is not unlikely that his agency was by no means
inconsiderable. Fuller, in speaking of the fierceness of the battle between
the fleets observes, that "bullets did not fly about so much at
sea, as bastardly libels did by land; so fitly called, because none durst
father them."</p>

<p>He established an English college at Rome and another at Valladolid,
for such of his countrymen as might follow him, or come otherwise
into exile. He published several works, but that by which he is best
known is entitled "Leicester's <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Commonweath'">Commonwealth</ins>," which, though abounding
with misstatements, vague rumors, and base insinuations, was
nevertheless a work of great ability. And although the pen of Sir
Philip Sidney was exercised in its refutation, he is not considered to
have completely effected his object. This most singular book of
Father Robert was first printed in 1641, and in less than 70 years had
become so rare that an edition of it was published, purporting to have
been printed from a <em>newly discovered manuscript</em>, and passed current
as such without detection, it is believed. To the original edition is appended
a poem, entitled "Leycester's Ghost," a great literary curiosity.
An extract from the poem is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Let no man think I exercis'd the Ghost</p>
<p class="verse">Of this great Peere that sleepeth in the dust,&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">Or conjur'd up his spirit to his cost</p>
<p class="verse">To presse with dispraise or praise unjust,</p>
<p class="verse">I am not partiall but give him his due,</p>
<p class="verse">And to his soule I wish eternall health,</p>
<p class="verse">Ne do I thinke all written tales are true,</p>
<p class="verse">That are inserted in his Common-wealth;</p>
<p class="verse">What others wrot before I do survive,</p>
<p class="verse">But am not like to them incenst with hate,</p>
<p class="verse">And as I plainely write, so do I strive</p>
<p class="verse">To write the truth, not wronging his estate.</p>
<p class="verse">Of whom it may bee said and censur'd well,</p>
<p class="verse">Hee both in vice and vertue did excell.</p>

<p>1556. <span class="smcap">Francis</span> was vicar of Rothwell in Nottinghamshire. There
is a wood called Parsons' wood, in the hundred of Nassaburgh, in the
same county.</p>

<p>1618. <span class="smcap">Bartholomew</span> appears as the author of three sermons&mdash;"First
Fruits of the Gentiles," 4to. In 1616, "Assize Sermon," 4to.
1631, "Dorcas, or a Perfect Patterne of a True Disciple," Sermon, 4to.

<p>1634. About this year Thomas Parsons was knighted by Charles I.
The foregoing engraving represents his arms, still retained in the family
in the United States, and by his descendants in London, among
whom were Sir John and Sir Humphrey; the former, Lord Mayor of
that city in 1704, the latter, in 1731 and 1740. The same coat of arms
is also retained by the branch of the Parsons family now long resident
in Barbadoes.</p>

<p>Langley in Buckinghamshire was long a seat of a family of the
name, but they seem to have abandoned it about the end of the 17th
century for a residence in Nottinghamshire. The first of this family
whose descendants we can trace appears to have been</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph</span>, of Northampton, who had a son</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>, who lived at Boveney, Co. Bucks, who had by his wife, dau.
of &mdash;&mdash; Cutler, Esq.,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> of Boveney and Langley, who m. Elisabeth, the sole heiress
of Sir John Kidderminster, and had,</p>

<p class="noindent pad2">
1. Charles, b. 1625, d. without issue.<br />
2. William, and three daughters.<br />
</p>

<p>This <span class="smcap">William</span>, the only surviving son, m. Elisabeth, dau. and heiress
of Sir Lawrence Parsons, by whom he had two sons; one a
Colonel, d. without issue, and John, his successor. <span class="smcap">William Parsons</span>
(the father) was made a baronet by Charles II. for his adherence to
the cause of his father, Charles I. He was somewhat conspicuous
during the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">interregnum</i>, as may be inferred from his granting a pass
to one of the gentlemen of the privy chamber, to proceed to Ireland.
The gentleman, however, having been taken by the parliament officers,
was, Carte says, put to the rack, "to make him confess." This circumstance
is supposed to have given Butler the ground he has taken in
these lines in his <cite>Hudibras</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Rack 'em until they do confess,</p>
<p class="verse">Impeach of treason whom they please,</p>
<p class="verse">And most perfidiously condemn,</p>
<p class="verse">Those that engaged their lives for them."</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Parsons</span> of Great Milton in Oxfordshire, (before mentioned,)
m. in 1614, Catharine, a dau. of Edward Radcliff of London,
son of Alderman Radcliff, by whom he had <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>, <span class="smcap">Richard</span>,
<span class="smcap">Anthony</span>, and six daughters. He was the son of <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> of the
same place, by his first wife, Judith Garbrand of the city of Oxford,
who also had a daughter Amy, m. to Richard Alworth of Turford,
Buckinghamshire. His second wife was Sarah, dau. of Edmund
Waller of Costell, by whom he had three sons, <span class="smcap">John</span>, <span class="smcap">Edmund</span>, <span class="smcap">Francis</span>,
and two daughters, Elisabeth, m. Anthony Radcliff of Chalford,
Co. Bucks, and Ann, wife of Richard Baldwin of Beaconsfield, in the
same county.</p>

<p>The grandfather of <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas</span> was <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> of Great Milton, who
m. Catharine, dau. of Hester Sydenham, by whom he had <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>,
<span class="smcap">Hugh</span>, and <span class="smcap">Richard</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> m. Miss &mdash;&mdash; Pierpont, and had a son <span class="smcap">John</span> of London,
who m. 1. a dau. of Joshua Whistler, by whom he had a daughter
Catharine; he m. 2. Mary Gualter of London. Some of this family
were among the early emigrants to America.</p>

<p>The first of the name we find in New England is <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>, Springfield,
1636, where he appears as a witness to the deed from the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
of the lands of that place and vicinity to William Pynchon and others,
on the fifteenth of July. There appear, however, soon after, at the
same place, <span class="smcap">Hugh</span> and <span class="smcap">Benjamin</span>. And family tradition relates that
<span class="smcap">Joseph</span> and <span class="smcap">Benjamin</span> were brothers, that they were born in Great
Torrington, near Exeter, Devonshire, England, who, with other children,
accompanied their father to New England, about the year 1630.
It is probable that they came over with Mr. Pynchon.</p>

<tr><td class="tdl">(1)</td><td class="tdlxy" colspan="2"><span class="smcap">Joseph Parsons</span>,<sup>1</sup> as has been mentioned,
            was at Springfield in 1636, where he probably remained until 1655, in which year he
            removed to Northampton. On the records of the latter town is this entry: "Joseph Parsons
            did at a Court in Northampton, holden March, 1662, testifie that he was a witness to a
            deed of the lands at Springfield, and a bargain betweene the Indians and Mr. Pynchon,

            knives."<br />

               &nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the town was incorporated he was elected
               "Townsman," (or selectman,) though he subsequently
               paid the town 20 shillings not to elect him to any office
               during the second year of its incorporation. After that
               we find him serving the town as "Townsman" for seven
               years. He was a principal founder of Northampton, was
               extensively engaged in the fur trade, and acquired a large

<p><span class="smcap">Hugh Parsons</span> appears on the town records of Springfield, 27. 8,
(27 Oct.) 1645. How long before that he was resident there does not
appear, though it is quite probable he was among the first inhabitants.
Whether <span class="smcap">Hugh</span> were a brother of Benjamin and Joseph, or what
relationship he may have borne to them, nothing has yet come to our
knowledge to enable us to determine; yet he was probably the older
brother of those, and so we shall consider him until we are otherwise
assured. Mr. Parsons married <em>Mary Lewis</em> on the date above mentioned,
by whom he had,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I. <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>, b. Oct. 4, 1648, d. Oct. 4, 1649.</p>
<p>II. <span class="smcap">Joshua</span>, b. Oct. 26, 1650, d. June 4, 1651.</p>
</div>

<p>About this point of time began the troubles and trials of this devoted
family, and here, on the Springfield town records stands the following
sad entry:</p>

<p>"<em>Joshua Parsons</em>, son of Hugh was killed by Mary Parsons his wife,
4. 1. 1651."</p>

<p>Singular as it may now seem, and notwithstanding the above entry,
fair and legible at this day upon the records, an attempt was soon after
made to throw the cause of the death of the son upon the father, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
that he had effected it by witchcraft! We will not now enlarge on this
subject, as we propose to publish at some future time an article on
witchcraft in our country, and its unhappy effects.</p>


<p class="p2">P. S. We originally intended to have given in this number the
genealogy of the branch of the family of Parsons settled at Gloucester,
but for want of room, and some materials, are obliged to defer it to a
future one; meanwhile we hope the descendants of <span class="smcap">Jeffrey Parsons</span>,
(the progenitor of this branch,) will forward us all the facts they possess
concerning it, that it may be rendered as complete as possible.
For the information of those concerned, it may be proper to state, that
we have a copy of the pedigree which was in the possession of the late
William Parsons, Esq., of Boston, which, though extensive as it respects
the names of the descendants, is very defective in dates and
names of places. In these particulars we especially want information.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>[For the account of the following medical gentlemen we are indebted to Dr. Samuel Pray.]</p>
</div>

<p><em>Dr. James Jackson</em> was the first physician who settled in Rochester.
He went from Connecticut, but in what year he went and how long
he lived in the town, is not known.</p>

<p><em>Dr. James How</em> was the son of Deacon How of Methuen, and brother
of David How, Esq., of Haverhill, Ms. He went to Rochester
about the year 1777, and practised in his profession till near the time of

several years, and was elected a member of the N. H. Medical Society
in 1791, soon after the Charter was granted. He was also surgeon's
mate in the army of the Revolution. He died at the age of 53.</p>

his profession in September, 1792, at Rochester, where he has resided
about fifty-five years. He united with a number of physicians in the old
County of Strafford in 1811, who constituted the Strafford District of the
N. H. Medical Society, of which he was Secretary several years. He
was elected a Fellow of the N. H. M. Society in 1816, and has been

native place.</p>

<p><em>Dr. John Perkins</em> went to Rochester in 1807, and resided there till
1815, when he moved with his family to Jaffrey. It is not known
where he received his education.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Asa Perkins</em> went from Dover, his native place, to Rochester, in
1816, and resided there two years, and then returned to Dover, where

Having abandoned his profession, he entered into mercantile business.</p>

<p><em>Dr. James Farrington</em> went to Rochester in August, 1818, and has
resided in town, to this time [1847]. He was born at Conway, October,
1791, and is the third son, now living, of Jeremiah Farrington, late
of Conway, who emigrated when a young man from Concord, N. H.,
and with several others formed a settlement upon the banks of the
Saco river, in that section of the country then called by the Indians
Pequawket, now Conway and Fryeburg; and grandson of Stephen
Farrington, who was one of the first settlers of Concord, and whose
wife was a sister of Jonathan and Samuel Bradley, who, with Obadiah
Peters, John Bean, and John Lufkin, were massacred by the Indians,
Aug. 11, 1746, between Concord and Hopkinton, and to whose memory
a granite monument has been erected on the spot where the massacre
was perpetrated, by their surviving relatives. He received an
academic education at Fryeburg Academy, where in 1814 he was prepared
to enter college. He commenced the study of medicine under
the tuition of Dr. Moses Chandler of Fryeburg, Me., February, 1815,
and concluded his term of study under the instruction of Dr. Jabez
Dow of Dover, in February, 1818. He was examined in the science
of medicine and surgery by the Censors of the N. H. Medical Society,

on the 9th of August following. He is a Fellow of the N. H.
Medical Society, and has been Censor and a Counsellor of the Society,
and for several years President of the Strafford District Society.
He has been a Representative and Senator in the State Legislature, and
in 1837 was elected a member of the 25th Congress of the United
States. In 1845 he was appointed by the Executive of the State one
of the Trustees of the N. H. Asylum for the Insane.</p>

<p>Dr. Farrington was married, in 1827, to Mary D., eldest daughter of
Mr. Joseph Hanson of Rochester, and has four children living; three
sons and one daughter. Formerly he had students in medicine, among
whom were Dr. Joseph H. Smith, now a successful practitioner in
Dover, Dr. Timothy Upham, an eminent physician, late of Waterford,
N. Y., and a son of the Hon. Nathaniel Upham, late of Rochester, also
Dr. Alfred Upham, now a physician in the city of New York.</p>

<h3>HON. NATHAN WESTON OF AUGUSTA, ME.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">John Weston</span>, from whom the subject of this memoir is the
fourth in descent, came from Buckinghamshire in England to this
country, in 1644, at the age of 13. After residing a few years
in Salem, he purchased a tract of land in what is now South Reading,
Ms., to which he removed, and where he spent the residue of his
days. He died in 1723; being more than 90 years of age. It is
noted on his gravestone, that he was one of the founders of the
church in Reading. A part of his estate remained in the hands of
his posterity for over one hundred years. Stephen, his son, was a
pious, industrious, and respectable man. He had a farm in Reading,
where he died in 1753, at the age of 88.</p>

<p>Stephen, his son, became the owner of a farm in Wilmington,
Ms. He was a leading man there, distinguished for his piety, and
was for many years Deacon of the church in that town, where he
died in 1776, in his 81st year. Nathan, his fifth son, was born at
Wilmington, in 1740. He married Elisabeth, the mother of the
subject of this Memoir. She was the daughter of Samuel Bancroft,
Esq., of Reading, who represented that town for many years
in the General Court, and sister of the late Rev. Dr. Bancroft of
Worcester. He (Nathan) removed to that part of Hallowell which
is now Augusta, in Maine, then a part of Massachusetts, in 1781.
He was for several years in the State government of Massachusetts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
being, at different times, a member of the House, Senate, and
Council of that Commonwealth. He died in 1832, at the advanced
age of nearly 93 years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathan Weston</span>, his son and the subject of this Memoir, was
born at Hallowell, now Augusta, July 27, 1782. He pursued his
studies, preparatory to his entering college, at Hallowell Academy,
under the direction of the late Preceptor Moody. He was graduated
at Dartmouth College, in 1803. He went immediately into the
study of the law. After reading a few months with Benjamin
Whitwell, Esq., of Augusta, he entered the office of George Blake,
Esq., Attorney for the United States, for the Massachusetts District,
at Boston, where he prosecuted his studies, until his admission to
the bar, in the county of Suffolk, in July, 1806.</p>

<p>He soon after opened an office at Augusta, but in March, 1807,
removed to New Gloucester, in the county of Cumberland, where
he continued in full practice in his profession three years, representing
that town in 1808, in the General Court of Massachusetts. In
June, 1809, he married Paulina B., daughter of the Hon. Daniel
Cony, and returned to Augusta, in March, 1810, where he now
(1847) resides. He continued the practice of the law until the fall
of 1811, when he was made Chief-Justice of the Circuit Court of
Common Pleas for the Second Eastern Circuit of Massachusetts,
in which he continued to officiate until the separation of Maine, in
1820. He then became one of the Judges of the Supreme Judicial
Court, and in October, 1834, he was appointed Chief-Justice of that
State, which office he held till October, 1841, when his term of
office expired. In 1831, the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws
was conferred upon him at Dartmouth College, and afterwards at
Waterville and Bowdoin Colleges, Maine.</p>

<p>In February, 1825, at a general meeting of the members of both
houses of the Legislature, then sitting in Portland, without distinction
of party, he was with great unanimity nominated for the office
of Governor, but preferring to remain on the bench, he declined the
nomination.</p>

<p>Judge Weston has four sons; Nathan, Daniel Cony, who married
Mary C. North, granddaughter of the late General William
North of New York, George Melville, and Charles. The first three
were educated at Bowdoin College, and are now in the practice of
law; one in Augusta, one in Orono, and one in Vassalborough, in
Maine. His third son, George Melville, is Attorney for the State
for the county of Kennebec. Charles, his fourth son, has been a
midshipman in the Navy of the United States. Of his daughters,
Paulina Cony died in 1820, aged two years. Two survive, namely,
Catharine Martin and Louisa Matilda.</p>

<p>Chief-Justice Weston is not known as the author of any published
work, beyond an occasional oration or address, in his
younger days; but the decisions of the Supreme Court of Maine,
now extended to about twenty volumes, are filled with legal opinions
drawn by him, which will remain a monument of his learning
and industry.</p>

<h3>HON. RICHARD LAW OF NEW LONDON, CT.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>[This memoir was obtained through the instrumentality of Prof. Kingsley of Yale College.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Law</span> was a son of the Hon. Jonathan Law, Governor
of Connecticut, and was born at Milford, on the 17th of March,
1733. He was educated at Yale College, where he was graduated
in 1751, and where also he received the degree of LL. D. Immediately
after graduating, he entered upon the study of the law, in the
office and under the instruction of that able jurist and accomplished
lawyer, the Hon. Jared Ingersoll; and after a course of studies
usual at that day, he was, soon after the age of 21, admitted to the
bar, at New Haven; and immediately removed, and settled at New
London, where he became highly distinguished in his profession. As
an advocate at the bar, his style was pure and correct, but not copious
and flowing. He was distinguished more as a learned lawyer, a
close logician, a fair special pleader, than an eloquent orator. His
talents were better adapted to a court than a jury. He possessed
a discrimination, and power of seeing and seizing the great point
in the case&mdash;the point on which it must turn; and by a course of
special pleadings&mdash;by drawing on the "<em>heartstrings of the law</em>,"
he had a faculty of presenting his point, by forming an issue in law
for the decision of the court, most favorably for his client; and on
such issues, from the logical structure of his mind, he was powerful.
He was thoroughly read in the ancient English law authorities;
and few American lawyers or jurists, of his day and age,
better understood the great principles of the English common law,
or could better discriminate between such of those principles as
were applicable to the genius of a republican government, and such
as were not, than Judge Law. Those which he adopted formed,
as it respected the common law, the polestar of his judicial
decisions.</p>

<p>After a full and lucrative practice of several years, in consequence
of ill health, he was induced to relinquish the bar, and accept a
seat as Chief-Judge on the Bench of the County Court for the
county of New London. This office he held until May, 1784,
when he was appointed one of the Judges of the Superior Court.</p>

<p>In May, 1776, he was chosen an Assistant, a member of the
Council or upper house of Assembly, which office he held by annual
elections of the freemen, until May, 1786, when an act was
passed excluding Judges from a seat in the Legislature.</p>

<p>In 1777, it is believed that at May session, he was appointed by
the General Assembly a member of Congress; and continued with
little, if any intermission, a member of that body until 1782.</p>

<p>On granting the charter to the city of New London, he was by
the freemen in March, 1784, unanimously chosen Mayor; which
office he held until his death&mdash;a period of nearly twenty-two years.</p>

<p>On the return of peace, after the Revolution, he was appointed
with the Hon. Roger Sherman, to revise the code of Statute Laws
of the State. This code had not been revised for thirty years, and
had accumulated to a great size, from the great variety of statutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
enacted in the emergencies of the Revolution. In its subjects of correction,
a work of great interest and importance, it required no
small ability so to select and discriminate as to give universal satisfaction.
In the discharge of which duty he discovered great knowledge
of the science of legislation, and the true principles of national
government.</p>

<p>In May, 1786, he was appointed Chief-Judge of the Superior
Court; and continued in that office until the adoption of the Constitution
of the United States; when being by President Washington
appointed District Judge of the District of Connecticut, in October,
1789, he resigned the former and accepted the latter, which
he held until his death, which occurred at New London, Jan. 26,
1806, in the 73rd year of his age.</p>

<p>Judge Law lived in an eventful period of his country, and of the
world; and the many and various important offices which he held
and honorably sustained through the course of a long life, better
bespeak, than language can express, the character, the worth, and
merits of the man.</p>


<h3>REV. NAPHTALI SHAW OF BRADFORD, VT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Naphtali Shaw</span> was born at Bridgewater, Ms., June 20, 1764,
and was the fourth son of his parents. His father, who was by
occupation a tanner and shoemaker, was William Shaw, who lived
in Bridgewater, and married Hannah, daughter of Samuel West,
who was a Deacon of the Congregational Church in that place, and
lived to be more than eighty years of age. He had five sons and
six daughters. At the age of fifteen the subject of this Memoir
enlisted as a soldier in the Revolutionary army, and went with others
to take Rhode Island, which was in 1779 in possession of the
British, but he did not continue long in the service, the object being
accomplished. He prepared for college under the instructions of
Dr. Crane, a physician of Titicut Parish, and the Rev. Dr. Reed of
West Bridgewater. In 1786, he entered the Freshman Class of
Dartmouth College, and graduated there in 1790. After receiving
his bachelor's degree, he taught school at Easton, Ms., and at Boston,
as an assistant of Mr. Caleb Bingham, an instructor of much
celebrity. His theological course of study was pursued under the
direction of the Rev. Dr. Sanger of Bridgewater, who was in the
habit of educating young men for the ministry. He was approbated
to preach the gospel, as it was then called, by the Plymouth Association
of Ministers, Aug. 1, 1792. Jan. 30, 1793, he was ordained
Pastor of the church in Kensington, N. H., where he remained till
Jan. 13, 1813, when he was dismissed on account of ill health. His
ministry was pacific and useful; peace and harmony were restored,
and the cause of education, morals, and religion promoted. His
health was such, that upon resignation, he retired from the ministry,
and devoted himself to agricultural pursuits, having purchased a farm
in the town of Bradford, Vt., where he still lives in the enjoyment of
his bodily and mental powers, to a good degree, at the age of 84 years.</p>

<p>Mr. Shaw married, June 10, 1798, Mary Crafts, daughter of Dr.
John Staples Crafts of Bridgewater, who was to him a great blessing.
"The greatest blessing," said Martin Luther, "with which a
man can be favored is a pious and amiable wife, who fears God
and loves her family, with whom he may live in peace, and in
whom he may repose confidence." The wife of Mr. Shaw died
Jan. 14, 1840. Their children were four;&mdash;Thomas Crafts, living
in Bradford, Vt., a farmer, and a deacon of the church in that place,
who married Sarah Jenkins, by whom he has two daughters, Sarah
Jane and Mary Ann; Eliza Park, who married Dea. Randell H.
Wild of West Fairlee, who died in Bradford, Dec. 22, 1841, leaving
two daughters, Elisabeth and Emily; Samuel West, who married
Jerusha Bliss of Fairlee, and died March 12, 1832, leaving no
child; Mary Ann, who died July 12, 1808, in childhood.</p>

<h2><a name="ADVICE" id="ADVICE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">ADVICE OF A DYING FATHER TO HIS SON.</a></h2>
    </div>

<p class="pfs80">Dated January 27, 1716.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The following article was addressed by the Rev. William Brattle of Cambridge to William
Brattle, his son and only child who lived to maturity, while he was preparing for college.
The father was a man distinguished for "piety, wisdom, and charity;" and the son "was a
man of extraordinary talents and character, acceptable as a preacher, eminent as a lawyer,
celebrated as a physician." He was a Major-General in the militia, and much in public office.
May it not be supposed that this paternal Advice from an affectionate father to a son of filial
affection and an obedient disposition, had great effect in making him what he was? For this
and several other articles of an antiquarian nature we are indebted to Charles Ewer, Esq.]</p></div>


<p>1. Agreeably to what is written 1 Chron. xxviii, 9, My dear Son,
know thou the God of thy father, &amp; serve him with a perfect heart, and
with a willing mind. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but
if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</p>

<p>2. Think often of thine own frailty, and of the uncertainly and emptiness
of all Sublunary Enjoyments. Value not Self upon riches.
Value not thy Self upon any worldly advancement whatsoever. Let
faith and Goodness be thy treasure. Let no happiness content and
Sattisfie thee but what secures the favour and peace of God unto thee.</p>

<p>3. Remember thy baptism, acquaint thy Self well with the nature
and obligations of that Ordinance. Publickly renew thy baptismall
Covenant. Renew it Seasonably in thy early Days with humility and
thirsty desires to enjoy Communion with God in the ordinance of the
Lord's Supper and in all Approaches before God therein bringing faith
and Love and a Self abasing Sence of thine own Emptiness and
unworthyness.</p>

<p>4. Prize and Esteem the holy word of God infinitly before the finest
of Gold. Reverence it with thy whole heart, read it constantly with
seriousness, and great delight. Meditate much upon it, make it thy
Guide in all thy wayes, fetch all thy Comforts from thence, and by a
religious and holy walk, establish thine Interest in the blessed and
glorious Promises therein contained.</p>

<p>5. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Reverence God's
Sanctuary. In prayer, in Singing, in hearing God's word Read or
preached, and in every public administration Wait upon God with
outward Reverence and true devotion in thine heart, Remembering
that holyness for ever becomes God's house. When in thy more private
retirements, Still let it be thy Care to Sanctifie God's Sabbath.
Be watchfull therefore over thine heart and over thy thoughts. Call
to mind and run over what thou hast heard in God's house. Read
Savoury books. Catechise thy Self, and others too when God gives
Opportunity.</p>

<p>6. Take care of thy health, avoid all Excess in eating and in drinking,
in taking thy pleasure, and in all innocent Recreations whatsoever.
Let not immoderate heatt and Colds needlessly Expose thy body.</p>

<p>7. Beware of Passion. Let not Anger and Wrath infect thine heart,
suffer wrong with Patience, Rather than to right thy Self by unchristian
methods, or by suffering thy spirit to be out of frame.</p>

<p>8. Labour to establish thy Self and begg of God that he would
Establish thee in the grace of Chastity, keep thine heart clean and
Chast, keep thy Tongue clean and Chast, keep thine hands clean and
Chast, keep thine Eyes clean and Chast. Never trust to thy Self to
be thy keeper, avoid temptations to uncleaness of every nature, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
watchfull over thy Self night and day, but in the midst of all Let
thine heart be with God, and be thou much in prayer, that God would
be thy keeper. Let all the incentives to Lust as farr as may be, be
avoided by thee.</p>

<p>9. Speak the Truth alwayes. Let not a Lye defile thy Lips, be
content with Suffering rather than by telling the Least Lie to Save
thy Self. Beware of Shuffling off by disimulation.</p>

<p>10. Let Pride be an abomination in thy Sight. Cloth thyself with
humility. Let humility be thine under Garment. Let humility be
thine upper Garment.</p>

<p>11. Despise no man, let the State of his Body or mind or other circumstances
of his, be what they will, still reverence humanity, consider
who made thee to differ.</p>

<p>12. Be just to all men; be thou courteous and affable to all men;
render not Evil for Evil, but recompense evil with Good. Owe no
man any thing but Love.</p>

<p>13. Be thou compassionate, tender hearted, and mercifull; do good
to all men, be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
for with such sacrifices God is evermore well pleased.</p>

<p>14. Avoid sloth and idleness, give thy Self to thy Studys; converse
with such Authors as may tend to make thee wise and good and to
forward thy growth in true wisdom and goodness.</p>

<p>15. Acquaint thy Self with History; know something of the Mathematicks,
and Physick; be able to keep Accompts Merchant like in
some measure; but let Divinity be thy main Study. Accomplish thy
Self for the worke of the Ministry, begg of God that he would incline
thine heart therto, and accept thee therin, and if it shall please
God thus to Smile upon thee, aspire not after great things; let the
Providence of God chuse for thee, and let the Flock have the Love of
thy heart; be Solicitous for their Spirituall good, and for the glory of
God; and let thy Aims be this way in all thy private meditations, and
public administrations, all the dayes of thy Life.</p>

<p>My dear Child, be of a Catholick Spirit.</p>

    </div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In old wills and other old documents the word <em>cousin</em> is sometimes used for <em>nephew</em>,
and thus many errors may occur in tracing out genealogies. Many curious cases of
relationship will be found to exist by those that investigate the descent of families,
some of which cannot be described by the terms we now use to designate consanguinity.
It is surprising, that among the many words that have been coined, some
new terms have not come into use as substitutes for the awkward way we now have
of naming some of our relatives; such as great-great-great grandfather, great-great-great-uncle,
&amp;c. The following curious case was taken from a newspaper; whether the
account is correct or not, the reader may see that it may be true.</p>

<p class="center">"<em>A man can be his own grandfather.</em></p>

<p>"A widow and her daughter-in-law and a man and his son&mdash;the widow married the
son, the daughter the father; the widow was mother to her husband's father and grandmother
to her husband; they had a son to whom she was great-grandmother. Now as
the son of a great-grandmother must be either a grandfather or great-uncle, the boy
must be one or the other. This was the case of a boy in Connecticut."</p></div>

<p>The following is an extract from "<span class="smcap">A new description of the world</span>,&mdash;London,
printed for Hen. Rhodes, next door to the Swan Tavern, near Brides-Lane,
in Fleet-Street, 1689."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>NEW ENGLAND</em>, an <em>English</em> Colony in America, is bounded on the North-East
with <em>Novumbegua</em>, on the Southwest with <em>Novum Belgium</em>; and on the
other parts by the Woods and Sea coast; scituate in the middle of Temperate
Zone, between the degrees of 41 and 44, equally distant from the Artick Circle,
and the Tropick of <em>Cancer</em>; which renders it very temperate and very agreeable
to the Constitution of <em>English</em> Bodies, the Soil being alike Fruitful, if not in
some places exceeding ours; all sorts of Grain and Fruit trees common with us
growing kindly there; The Woods there are very great, wherein for the most
part the Native <em>Indians</em> dwell Fortefying themselves as in Towns or places of
defence, living upon Deer and such other Creatures, as those vast Wildernesses
whose extents are unknown to the <em>English</em> abound with; there are in this
Country store of Ducks, Geese, Turkies, Pigeons, Cranes, Swans, Partridges,
and almost all sort of Fowl, and Cattle, common to us in <em>Old England</em>; together
with Furs, Amber, Flax, Pitch, Cables, Mast, and in brief whatever may conduce
to profit and pleasure; the Native <em>Indians</em>, in these parts are more tractable,
if well used, than in any other; many of them though unconverted, often
saying, that our God is a good God, but their <em>Tanto</em> evil, which <em>Tanto</em> is no
other than the Devil, or a wicked Spirit that haunts them every Moon, which
obliges them to Worship him for fear, though to those that are converted to
Christianity he never appears.</p>

<p>This <em>English</em> Colony after many Attempts and bad Successes was firmly
Established 1620, at what time <em>New Plymouth</em> was Built and Fortified; so that
the <em>Indians</em> thereby being over-aw'd, suffered the Planters without controul to
Build other Towns, the chief of which are <em>Bristol</em>, <em>Boston</em>, <em>Barnstaple</em>, and others,
alluding to the Names of Sea Towns in <em>Old England</em>; and are accommodated
with many curious Havens commodious for Shipping, and the Country
watered with pleasant Rivers of extraordinary largeness; so abounding with
Fish, that they are not taken for dainties; and for a long time they were all
Governed at their own dispose, and Laws made by a Convocation of Planters,
<em>&amp;c.</em> but of late they have submitted to receive a Governor from <em>England</em>.</p>

<p><em>NOVUM BELGIUM</em>, or the <em>New Neitherlands</em>, lies in this tract on the South
of <em>New England</em>, extending from 38 to 41 degrees North Latitude; a place into
which the <em>Hollanders</em> intruded themselves, considerable Woody; which Woods
naturally abound with Nuts and wild Grapes, replenished with Deer, and such
Creatures as yield them store of Furrs, as the Rivers and Plains do Fish and
Fowl; rich Pastures, and Trees of extraordinary bigness, with Flax, Hemp,
and Herbage; the ground very kindly bearing the Product of <em>Europe</em>; and here
the Natives, such as live in Hutts and Woods, go clad in Beasts Skins, their
Household goods consisting of a Wooden dish, a Tobacco Pipe, and a Hatchet
made of a sharp Flint Stone, their Weapons Bows and Arrows; though the
<em>Dutch</em> unfairly to their cost, out of a covetous Humor, traded with them for
Guns, Swords, <em>&amp;c.</em>, shewing the use of them which the <em>Indians</em> turning upon
their quondam Owners, found an opportunity to send 400 of their new Guests
into the other World; and here the chief Town is <em>New Amsterdam</em>, commodiously
Scituate for Trade, and the Reception of Shipping.</p></div>

<h2><a name="GEN" id="GEN"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">GENEALOGIES AND THEIR MORAL.</a></h2>
    </div>


<p>We were carelessly looking over a genealogy of the "Minot Family" in the
second number of the "New England Historical and Genealogical Register,"
when suddenly our eyes were suffused with tears, as they rested on the following
sentence in the catalogue of the children of Capt. John Minot, who died in
Dorchester, 1669:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Martha, born Sept. 22, 1657; died, single, Nov. 23, 1678, aged 21. She was engaged
to be married, but died unmarried, leaving a will in which she directed that at her
funeral her betrothed husband, 'John Morgan, Jr. be all over mourning, and follow next
after me.'"</p></div>

<p>What a history is there in these few words about Martha Minot, who lived
almost two centuries ago! The mind runs back in a moment to those times,
when almost all New England was a wilderness&mdash;to those days of the old
Indian wars, when no man could be a "captain" without being a man of some
rank and consequence. Just after the close of King Philip's war, when the
villages of New England were all in peace, Capt. John Minot's daughter Martha,
twenty-one years of age, and having come into possession of her share of
her father's estate, had plighted her troth to one she loved, and was expecting
to be married too, when disease fastened upon her young frame, and would not
be repelled. In the chill November air, when</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"The melancholy days were come, the saddest of the year,"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">she faded like a leaf. And at her burial there followed, nearer than brother or
sister, nearest to the hearse, the one whom, of all the living, she loved most, from
whom to part had been to her more painful than the death-pang, and who had
been in her thoughts till "the love-light in her eye" was extinguished. That
single item in her directions for her funeral, that "John Morgan, Jr., be all over
mourning, and follow next after me," tells the whole story.</p>

<p>Nothing seems, at first sight, less interesting or less instructive, than a genealogical
table, a mere register of names and dates. But such a passage as that
which we have quoted&mdash;so picturesque, so suggestive, so touching, so dramatic&mdash;when
it occurs in the midst of these dry records, throws out an electric light
at every link in the chain of generations. Each of those names in the table
is the memorial&mdash;perhaps the only memorial&mdash;of a human heart that once
lived and loved; a heart that kept its steady pulsations through some certain
period of time, and then ceased to beat and mouldered into dust. Each of those
names is the memorial of an individual human life that had its joys and sorrows,
its cares and burthens, its affections and hopes, its conflicts and achievements,
its opportunities wasted or improved, and its hour of death. Each of
those dates of "birth," "marriage," "death,"&mdash;O how significant! What a
day was each of those dates to some human family, or to some circle of loving
human hearts!</p>

<p>To read a genealogy then may be, to a thinking mind, like walking in a
cemetery, and reading the inscriptions on the gravestones. As we read, we
may say with the poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"To a mysteriously-consorted pair,</p>
<p class="verse">This place is consecrate&mdash;to Death and Life."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The presence of death drives the mind to thoughts of immortality. Memorials
of the dead are memorials not of death only, but of life. They lived, and
therefore they died; and as the mind thinks of the dead gathered to their fathers,
it cannot but think of the unseen worlds which they inhabit. All these
names are memorials of human spirits that have passed from time into eternity.
Ready or unprepared, in youth or in maturity, in childhood or in old age, they
went into eternity, as we are going.</p>

<p>The genealogical chapters in Genesis and Chronicles are commonly and very
naturally regarded as being almost if not quite an exception to the testimony,
"All Scripture is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness." But the story is told of a man who had long been irreligious
and thoughtless, that in some vacant hour he happened to open his
Bible, and began to read the catalogue of antediluvians, in the fifth chapter of
Genesis. As he read that one lived so many years and he <em>died</em>, and another
lived so many years and he died, the uniformity of the record arrested his
attention, his mind was awakened to new thoughts of the significancy of death
and life, and thus he was led to realize the ends of his existence, and to dedicate
himself, in penitence and trust, to a forgiving God.&mdash;<cite>New York Evangelist.</cite></p>

<p><em>The American Loyalists, or Biographical Sketches of Adherents to the British
Crown in the War of the Revolution; alphabetically arranged; with a preliminary
Historical Essay. By James Sabine.</em> Boston: Charles C. Little and James
Brown. MDCCCXLVII.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Sabine, it is believed, is a merchant at Eastport, Me., but still has been in the
habit of composing for the press. He has written articles for the North American
Review, and is the author of the Memoir of Commodore Preble in Prof. Sparks's
American Biography.</p>

<p>The subject of his present work is both novel and interesting, and one upon which
we are too ignorant. The most intelligent and best informed among us have but little
knowledge of the names and characters of the Loyalists, or Tories of the Revolution,
(probably twenty thousand in number,) and of the reasons which influenced, of the
hopes and fears which agitated, and of the rewards or miseries which awaited them.
Separated from their homes and kindred, outlaws, wanderers, and exiles, they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
left but few memorials to their posterity. The difficult task of collecting and arranging
fragmentary events and incidents relating to them, scattered here and there, we
think the author has succeeded admirably in accomplishing. We find among the
sketches, notices of many distinguished and influential men, and while some were notorious
for their want of principle, there were many who, we cannot doubt, were true
and honest in espousing the cause of the mother country. Then, though we cannot
justify any, let us not censure all. "The <em>winners</em> in the Revolutionary strife are now
twenty millions; and, strong, rich, and prosperous, can <em>afford</em> to speak of the losers in
terms of moderation."</p>

<p>The Historical Essay, containing one hundred and fourteen pages, which precedes
the "Biographical Sketches," indicates much acquaintance with the Revolution and its
causes, and is very valuable and highly appropriate.</p>

<p>The work makes a handsome volume of 733 pages, and is well worthy of being
perused, and of a place in the library of the historian.</p></div>

<p><em>A Genealogical and Biographical Sketch of the Name and Family of Stetson;
from the year 1634 to the year 1847. By John Stetson Barry. "Virtus nobilitat
omnia."</em> Boston: Printed for the author by William A. Hall &amp; Co. 1847.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The name of Stetson is spelt differently in old records; as Stitson, Sturtson, Studson,
Stedson, Stutson, and Stetson. The last is the usual method of spelling the name,
though some families spell it Stutson. The first of the name and the ancestor of all
in this country was Robert Stetson, commonly called <em>Cornet</em> Robert, because he was
Cornet of the first horse company raised in Plymouth colony, Ms., in the year 1658 or
'9. He settled in Scituate, Ms., in the year 1634, but it is not known satisfactorily
whence he originated, though tradition says he came from the county of Kent, England.</p>

<p>Among his descendants are many who have held offices of trust and responsibility,
and who have stood high in public esteem.</p>

<p>The pamphlet contains 116 pages, and gives a pretty full account of the Stetson family.
We hope it will be an additional incentive to others to prepare memorials of their
ancestors.</p></div>

December 22, 1846. By Charles W. Upham.</em> New York: Published by John S.
Taylor, Brick Church Chapel, 151 Nassau Street. 1847.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is an excellent address, written in a clear, graceful, and forcible manner. After
describing the influences, both in the Old World and in the New, which were at work,
and the combination of which resulted in the advent of our fathers to these desert
shores, the orator remarks upon the Puritans, and the chief elements of their character
and the result of their labors. The blessings of a free government and religious liberty
are largely descanted upon, and the address closes as follows: "If the sons of New
England rear the school-house and the church wherever they select their homes; if
they preserve the reliance upon their own individual energies, the love of knowledge,
the trust in Providence, the spirit of patriotic faith and hope, which made its most barren
regions blossom and become fruitful around their fathers, then will the glorious
vision of those fathers be realized, and the Continent rejoice, in all its latitudes and
from sea to sea, in the blessings of freedom and education, of peace and prosperity, of
virtue and religion."</p></div>

<p><em>A Sermon preached at Northwood, N. H., March 12, 1847, on the death of Dea.
Simon Batchelder. By Elliot C. Cogswell, Pastor of the Congregational Church.
Published by request.</em> Concord: Printed by Morrill, Silsby, &amp; Co. 1847.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The text on which this discourse is founded is contained in Acts viii: 2. "And
devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him." It
is divided into six heads. When the good man dies the people of God lose, 1. His society.
2. His sympathy. 3. His counsels. 4. His prayers. 5. His coöperation. 6. His
admonitions. The subject is well treated, and the language affectionate and appropriate.
Dea. Batchelder was born, March 5, 1758. He was the son of Davis Batchelder of
Northampton, who moved to Northwood about 1770; who married, 1. Mary Taylor of
Hampton, by whom he had four children; 2. Ruth Palmer; and 3. a Widow Marston;
by whom, (the last two wives,) he had fourteen children, four of whom survive. Dea.
Batchelder at the age of eighteen enlisted in the war of the Revolution, in 1776, and
served in Capt. Adams's company and Col. Poor's regiment at Winter Hill in Charlestown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Newport, R. I., and Ticonderoga, N. Y. April 4, 1778, he married Rachel Johnson,
daughter of Benjamin Johnson, with whom he lived about fifty-two years, she
dying Jan. 5, 1830, aged 73. By her he had seven children, five of whom still survive.
He died March 10, 1847, aged 89 years and 5 days.</p></div>

<p><em>A Discourse delivered before the Rhode Island Historical Society, on the evening
of Wednesday, January 13, 1847. By Hon. Job Durfee, Chief-Justice of Rhode
Island. Published at the request of the Society.</em> Providence: Charles Burnett,
Jr. 1847.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The subject of this discourse is "Rhode Island's Idea of Government." Judge Durfee
speaks of the "origin of this idea&mdash;of the various forms which it took in its progress
towards its realization in that state, in minds of much diversity of character and creed;
and of that 'lively experiment,' which it subsequently held forth, that 'a most flourishing
civil state may stand, and be best maintained, with a full liberty in religious
concernments'&mdash;a liberty which implied an emancipation of reason from the thraldom
of arbitrary authority, and the full freedom of inquiry in all matters of speculative
faith."</p>

<p>Though to the founders of Rhode Island, and particularly to Roger Williams, belong
the fame and glory of having realized this idea in the form of a civil government, they
were by no means the first to maintain it. Long before the Reformation it originated
among the Waldenses in the valleys of Piedmont, and by means of the crusade against
them by Innocent III., it was spread far and wide. The Reformation and the coming
of the Puritans to America tended to confirm it, but never was it fully realized till
Roger Williams and his followers came to "the forest-shaded banks of the Mooshausic,"
and established a government on the principle that "the State has no right to interfere
between conscience and God."</p>

<p>After dwelling largely on the early history and influence of Rhode Island, the author
passes to the time of the Revolution. We find that this little state, though royally
armed in her Charter, stood among the foremost in the great struggle for independence.
She was the first to direct her officers to disregard the Stamp Act, and to assure them
indemnity for so doing; the first to recommend the permanent establishment of a Continental
Congress; the first to adopt the Articles of Confederation; the first to brave
royalty in arms; the first to enact and declare independence; the first to establish a
naval armament of her own; and the first to recommend to Congress the establishment
of a Continental Navy. The oration closes with an eloquent appeal to preserve the
history and early records of the State. Appended is a Poem by Sarah Helen Whitman,
recited before the Rhode Island Historical Society, previous to the delivery of the address.</p></div>

<p>This is an exceedingly valuable and highly interesting work, and appears to have
been written with great labor, and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</i>. The author seems, as he says, "to have
made a broad distinction between fact and tradition, and to have related nothing as fact,
which he did not believe to be true." The representation of the character of the
inhabitants of Newbury and their transactions, we think is accurately given, and seems
to have been given "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine ira, sine studio</i>." Copious extracts are made from the town
records, and many from the church records, which latter exhibit more fully the peculiar
traits of our ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The town of Newbury was originally one of the largest towns in the county, being
about thirteen miles long, and about six miles broad in the widest place, and containing
about thirty thousand acres, of which nearly two thousand were covered with
water. In 1764 it was divided into two towns, Newbury and Newburyport, and in 1819
West Newbury was set off and incorporated as a separate town.</p>

<p>This volume is embellished with portraits of Dr. John Clarke, the physician in
Newbury from 1637 to 1651, who died in Boston in 1664, aged 66, Chief-Justice Sewall,
Rev. Mr. Whitefield, and Rev. Dr. Parish, and also with a map of the town and engravings
of the old-town meeting-house which stood one hundred and six years, from 1700
to 1806, and of a house which "was infested with demons" in 1679, and where, "before
the devil was chained up, the <em>invisible</em> hand did begin to put forth an astonishing <em>visibility</em>!"
The Appendix, containing among other things a List of Grantees, and Genealogies
of the First Settlers from 1635 to 1700, is a very important part of the work. The
conclusion, comprising about fifty pages, is also valuable.</p></div>

<p><em>Brookline Jubilee. A Discourse delivered in Brookline, at the request of its
Inhabitants, on 15 March, 1847, the day, which completed half a Century from
his Ordination, by John Pierce, D. D., fifth minister of the first Congregational
Church and Society in said town.</em> Boston: James Munroe and Company.
MDCCCXLVII.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The text on which this discourse is founded is in Psalm xxxvii: 25. "I have been
young and now am old."</p>

<p>It is indeed pleasant in these "moving times," when ministers are not settled during
even good behavior, but only so long as they please the fastidious taste of their people,
to behold a pastor who has remained with his flock a long series of years, who stands
among them, a relic of a former generation, to guide them by his counsels and guard
them with his watchful care. It is alike honorable to the pastor and his people to
meet in one common jubilee, to thank the bounteous Giver of all things for his mercies,
and strengthen the ties which have so long bound them together. In the present case,
however, not a church merely, but a whole town have united to honor one who may
be regarded as their father, and whose name is identified with the town.</p>

<p>The sermon contains, as might be expected from Dr. Pierce, an immense amount of
historical facts, some of them of a general, but most of them of a local character. The
town of Brookline was incorporated Nov. 13, 1705, O. S., and the first Congregational
church was gathered Oct. 26, 1717, O. S., of which Dr. Pierce is the fifth
pastor. Since his settlement nearly all who were then around him have departed
this life, while he, now enjoying a "green old age," stands almost alone. The discourse
is very valuable for the history it contains, and is written in a candid and an
affectionate manner. Appended is an exceedingly interesting account of the proceedings
of the day, which was published in the Christian Register, and other papers in
Boston. We regret that we have not room to insert extracts from it. Dr. Pierce will
go down to the grave beloved and respected by all ministers and people who knew
him, whether of his own or other denominations.</p></div>

<p><em>A Discourse on the Cambridge Church-Gathering in 1636; delivered in the First
Church, on Sunday, February 22, 1846. By William Newell, Pastor of the First
Church in Cambridge.</em> Boston: James Munroe and Company. 1846.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The text is from Psalm xliv. 1-3. "We have heard with our ears, O God, our
fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days in the times of old. How
thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedest them.... For
they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm
save them; but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance,
because thou hadst a favor unto them."</p>

<p>This discourse contains an account of the formation of the church in Cambridge,
and of some of the events preceding it, and brief notices of the principal actors. It
contains also many other valuable facts. There is an appendix containing nineteen
pages of great value, embracing among other things a list of the members of the church,
"taken and registered in the 11 month, 1658," and brief genealogical notices of one
hundred and seventeen individuals. In giving this sermon to the public, Mr. Newell
has rendered an important service.</p></div>

Endecott, (a man, who to the qualities which have rendered him illustrious, as an effectual
leader of colonization, as a gallant soldier, as a skillful statesman, added a knowledge of the
Scriptures, and a devout piety, which will ever hallow his memory,) early in the year 1629,
before the formation of this church, wrote to Gov. Bradford respecting a conference he had
held with a gentleman sent to him from Plymouth, (Dr. Fuller.) on the subject of church institution
and government. In this letter we find no acknowledgment of any other authority in
such a matter than his own private judgment, and no desire expressed, or attempt exhibited,
to force his judgment upon others." The letter here referred to is the one already cited, of
May 11, 1629. "The standard," says Mr. Upham, "by which Mr. Endecott made up his
judgment in this matter, was certainly no other than the standard of Protestantism&mdash;the
Scriptures, as they were opened to his understanding."</p></div>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
